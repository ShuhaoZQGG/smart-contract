## Deferred from Cycle 1

- None - all planned features were successfully implemented

## Notes for Next Developer

1. Start from main branch (PR #55 already merged at 2025-09-04T06:41:31Z)
2. Check Supabase Dashboard for manual configurations (HaveIBeenPwned, MFA)
3. Consider creating feature branches for each P0 task
4. Maintain backward compatibility with existing API
5. Keep bundle size optimization in mind during development
6. Run full test suite before creating PRs
7. All core features are operational - focus on optimization and enhancements
