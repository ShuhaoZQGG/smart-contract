6. **Build enterprise API** for B2B customers

## Notes
- All features should maintain backward compatibility
- Focus on user experience and performance
- Ensure all new features have proper test coverage
- Maintain WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- Security configuration (MFA, password protection) is IMMEDIATE priority
