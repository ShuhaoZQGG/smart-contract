# Next Cycle Tasks - Smart Contract Document Template System

## Immediate Actions Required

### PR Management Priority
1. **Resolve PR #48 Merge Conflicts**
   - Current state: mergeable_state = dirty
   - Option A: Resolve conflicts in current branch
   - Option B: Close PR #48 and create fresh PR from updated main
   
2. **Merge Pending PRs in Order**
   - PR #45: Planning documentation
   - PR #46: Test improvements
   - PR #47: Documentation updates
   - PR #48: After conflict resolution

### Manual Configuration Required
1. **Supabase Dashboard Security Settings**
   - Enable HaveIBeenPwned password protection
   - Configure additional MFA options
   - These cannot be set via API/MCP

## Cycle 2 Development Priorities

### Performance Optimization
- **Bundle Size**: Reduce from 107KB to <100KB target
  - Tree shaking optimization
  - Code splitting implementation
  - Lazy loading for non-critical components

### Test Suite Enhancement
- **Fix 18 Failing Tests**: Mock-related issues
  - Refine Supabase mock chain methods
  - Improve test coverage from 81.4% to >95%
  - Add E2E testing suite

### Enterprise Features
1. **Payment Processing**
   - Stripe integration for template marketplace
   - Subscription tiers implementation
   - Revenue sharing for template creators

2. **API v2 Development**
   - RESTful API for external integrations
   - GraphQL endpoint for flexible queries
   - Rate limiting and API key management

3. **Enhanced Marketplace**
   - Full backend for ratings/reviews
   - Template analytics dashboard
   - Creator revenue tracking

4. **Webhook System**
   - Event-driven architecture
   - Webhook delivery with retry logic
   - Integration with Zapier/Make

## Technical Debt Items

### Database Optimization
- Query performance tuning
- Index optimization
- Implement caching layer (Redis)
- Connection pooling configuration

### Security Enhancements
- Implement Content Security Policy
- Add request signing for Edge Functions
- Enhanced audit logging
- GDPR compliance features

### Developer Experience
- Comprehensive API documentation
- SDK development (JavaScript, Python)
- CLI tool for template management
- Improved error handling and logging

## Deferred from Cycle 1

### Non-Critical Improvements
- Bundle size optimization (7KB reduction needed)
- Test mock refinements
- Performance benchmarking suite
- Load testing implementation

### Documentation
- Deployment guide with Supabase setup
- API documentation site
- Video tutorials for template creation
- Best practices guide

## Success Metrics for Cycle 2

- Bundle size: <100KB
- Test coverage: >95%
- All security advisors resolved
- Payment processing operational
- API v2 deployed
- 0 critical vulnerabilities
- Page load time: <2s
- Lighthouse score: >95

## Infrastructure Status (Verified)
âœ… **Current Production Ready State**:
- 16 database tables with RLS policies
- 5 Edge Functions deployed and active
- Authentication system operational
- Real-time collaboration working
- Template marketplace UI complete

## Notes
- All core features from Cycle 1 are complete and operational
- Infrastructure verified via Supabase MCP tools
- Production deployment possible after PR merge and security config
- Focus on enterprise features and optimization in Cycle 2
