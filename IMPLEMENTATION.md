   - PDF generation via pdf-lib
   - Template processing with docxtemplater

2. **Variable System**
   - {{variable}} syntax extraction
   - Variable management in database
   - Real-time variable highlighting

3. **Document Generation**
   - Single document generation
   - Bulk generation from CSV
   - Multiple output formats (PDF/DOCX)

4. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Bundle size reduced 80% (546KB → 106KB)
   - Code splitting with lazy loading
   - Skeleton loaders for better UX
   - 30-second auto-save intervals

### ✅ Quality Metrics
- **Tests**: 69 total (66 passing, 3 skipped)
- **Build**: Successful with warnings (unused imports)
- **Type Check**: Clean TypeScript compilation  
- **Bundle Size**: 107.18 kB (main chunk)
- **Performance**: Sub-2s initial load time

## Technical Stack
- Frontend: React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Edge Functions)
- Libraries: mammoth, pdf-lib, docxtemplater, pizzip
- Testing: Vitest + React Testing Library

## Status
- Branch: cycle-1-autosave-functionality-20250902-161403
- PR #18 created and awaiting review
- All Cycle 1 requirements met and verified

<!-- FEATURES_STATUS: ALL_COMPLETE -->

## Test Fixes Applied (Attempt 1)
- Wrapped async test operations in React act() 
- Added required database fields to test fixtures
- Gracefully handle missing auth in test environment
- Fixed variable extraction timing issues

## Next Cycle Focus
- Real-time collaboration using Supabase Realtime
