## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
```typescript
{
  framework: "React 18.3",
  language: "TypeScript 5.6",
  editor: "Lexical (Facebook)",
  ui: "Shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS",
  state: "Zustand + React Query",
  build: "Vite"
}
```

### Backend
```typescript
{
  database: "Supabase PostgreSQL",
  auth: "Supabase Auth",
  storage: "Supabase Storage",
  functions: "Supabase Edge Functions (Deno)",
  realtime: "Supabase Realtime (WebSocket)"
}
```

### Document Processing
- `mammoth.js` - DOCX text extraction
- `pdf-lib` - PDF generation
- `docxtemplater` + `pizzip` - Template processing
- `papaparse` - CSV parsing

## Performance Metrics
| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| Initial Load | 1.5s | <2s | ✅ |
| Bundle Size | 107KB | <100KB | ⚠️ |
| Time to Interactive | 1.8s | <2s | ✅ |
| Lighthouse Score | 92 | >90 | ✅ |

## Security Assessment

### Implemented
- Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
- Authentication required for all operations
- Secure file storage with access controls
- Input validation and sanitization
- XSS prevention measures

### Pending Configuration
1. **Supabase Auth Settings**:
   - Enable leaked password protection (HaveIBeenPwned)
   - Configure additional MFA options (TOTP, SMS)
2. **Rate Limiting**: Add to Edge Functions
3. **Audit Logging**: Implement activity tracking

## Known Issues (Non-Critical)

### Testing
- Jest mocking issues with Supabase client (1 test suite)
- Does not affect production functionality

### Performance
- Bundle size at 107KB (7KB over target)
- 12 unused database indexes (no impact)

### Build Warnings
- Some unused imports (cleanup needed)
- No functional impact

## Migration Path
```bash
# No migrations needed - all features complete
# Main branch contains:
- All Cycle 1 core features
