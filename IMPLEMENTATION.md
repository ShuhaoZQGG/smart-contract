# Cycle 1 Development Implementation Summary

## Completed Features

### Core Infrastructure
- **Database**: PostgreSQL schema deployed via Supabase migrations
  - Templates, Variables, Versions, Generated Documents tables
  - Row-Level Security policies for all tables
  - Storage buckets for templates and generated files

### Authentication & Security
- Supabase Auth integration with email/password
- Protected routes with auth context
- RLS policies ensuring users only access their data

### Frontend Application
- React + TypeScript with Vite build system
- Tailwind CSS for responsive styling
- Pages: Home, Login, Dashboard, Template Editor, Document Generator

### Document Management
- Upload documents to create templates
- Visual template editor with variable insertion
- Variable management (types, defaults, validation)
- Single and bulk document generation
- CSV upload for batch processing

### Backend Services
- Edge Function for document processing
- Supabase Storage for file management
- Version tracking for templates

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions)
- **Deployment**: Ready for Vercel (frontend) + Supabase (backend)

## Known Limitations
- Document processing currently outputs plain text (needs DOCX/PDF libraries)
- Variable extraction from uploaded documents needs enhancement
- Download functionality pending implementation

## Next Phase Priorities
1. Integrate proper document processing libraries
2. Add Shadcn/ui components for improved UI
3. Implement comprehensive testing
4. Deploy to production
