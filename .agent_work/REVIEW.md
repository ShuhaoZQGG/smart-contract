1. **Security Configuration Required** (Manual Supabase Dashboard):

   - [Additional MFA options](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-mfa) need configuration

2. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - 32 unused database indexes (normal for new app)
   - Duplicate RLS policies on audit_logs and rate_limits tables

3. **Test Suite**:

### üöÄ Next Steps
Since PR #41 is already merged, Cycle 2 development can begin immediately from the main branch. Priority tasks:

2. **Cycle 2**: Payment processing, enterprise features, advanced variables
3. **Technical Debt**: Fix test mocks, optimize database indexes

The application is **production-ready** with all Cycle 1 features complete and functional.
