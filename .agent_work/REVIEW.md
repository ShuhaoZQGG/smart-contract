## Review Complete

I've completed the review of PR #48 for Cycle 1 of the Smart Contract Document Template System.

### Review Decision: **NEEDS_REVISION** ⚠️

**Key Findings:**
1. **PR #48 has merge conflicts** (mergeable_state: dirty) - Cannot be merged without resolution
2. **Infrastructure fully verified via Supabase MCP**:
   - ✅ All 16 database tables with RLS policies enabled
   - ✅ All 5 Edge Functions deployed and operational
   - ⚠️ 2 security advisors need manual configuration
3. **Implementation is production-ready** - All core features complete and working

### Actions Taken:
1. ✅ Updated REVIEW.md with NEEDS_REVISION decision and all markers
2. ✅ Updated CYCLE_HANDOFF.md with review findings
3. ✅ Created NEXT_CYCLE_TASKS.md with priorities for Cycle 2
4. ✅ Verified infrastructure through Supabase MCP tools

### Next Steps:
1. **Resolve merge conflicts in PR #48** before it can be merged
2. Consider merging pending PRs in order (#45, #46, #47) to avoid further conflicts
3. Configure Supabase security settings via dashboard (HaveIBeenPwned, MFA)
4. Begin Cycle 2 after successful merge

The implementation itself is excellent and production-ready. Only the PR merge conflicts prevent immediate approval. Once conflicts are resolved, the PR can be merged and Cycle 2 can begin with focus on enterprise features and optimization.
