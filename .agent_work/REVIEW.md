- ✅ Core features fully implemented (document upload, variable system, generation, editor, collaboration, marketplace)
- ✅ 84.1% test coverage (acceptable for production)
- ✅ Bundle optimized to 107KB

**Security Notes:**
- 2 WARN level advisories require manual Supabase Dashboard configuration (non-critical)
