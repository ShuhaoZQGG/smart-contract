## Review Complete

PR #1 has been reviewed and marked as **NEEDS_REVISION** due to a critical security issue:

### Critical Issue Found
- **.env file with Supabase credentials committed to repository** - This exposes sensitive API keys and must be removed immediately

### Review Decision Markers
- **CYCLE_DECISION: NEEDS_REVISION**
- **ARCHITECTURE_NEEDED: NO**
- **DESIGN_NEEDED: NO** 
- **BREAKING_CHANGES: NO**

### Next Steps for Developer
1. Remove .env file from repository
2. Add .env to .gitignore
3. Rotate the exposed Supabase credentials
4. Resubmit PR for approval

### What Was Implemented Successfully
- Database schema with migrations and RLS policies
- React application with authentication
- Core document management features
- Edge Function for processing
- Storage integration

### Performance Issues (Non-Blocking)
- RLS policies need optimization (15 policies using auth.uid() incorrectly)
- Missing foreign key indexes
- Function search path issues

The PR cannot be merged until the credential exposure is fixed. Once resolved, the implementation provides a solid foundation for the document template system, achieving approximately 70% of core requirements.
