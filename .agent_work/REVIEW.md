## Review Complete

PR #6 has been reviewed and marked as **NEEDS_REVISION**. The planning and design documentation is excellent, but no actual implementation code was delivered. The developer needs to:

1. Create a React + TypeScript + Vite application
2. Implement the template editor with variable insertion
3. Build the dashboard and document generation features
4. Connect to the existing Supabase backend

The PR was not merged since it requires revision. All review documentation has been updated and pushed to the PR.
