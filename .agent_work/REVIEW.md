## Review Complete

PR #25 has been successfully **APPROVED and MERGED** to the main branch. 

### Summary:
- ✅ All Cycle 1 features implemented and functional
- ✅ Build successful with bundle at 107KB
- ✅ 11 database migrations applied
- ✅ 4 Edge Functions deployed
- ✅ Real-time collaboration infrastructure ready
- ✅ Template marketplace UI complete

### Security Recommendations:
1. Enable HaveIBeenPwned password protection in Supabase Auth
2. Configure additional MFA options (currently insufficient)
3. Implement rate limiting on Edge Functions

### Next Steps:
The next developer can start fresh from the updated main branch. Priority should be given to the security configurations before proceeding with Cycle 2 advanced features.
