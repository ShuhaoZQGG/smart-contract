# Cycle 1 Development Implementation Summary

## Tasks Completed

### Test Infrastructure Improvements
- **ConflictResolution.test.tsx**: Improved Supabase mock chain handling for complex query patterns
- **TemplateComments.test.tsx**: Updated mock to handle select().eq().is().order() chains
- **AdvancedVariables.test.tsx**: Fixed mock implementation for advanced_variables table queries

### Infrastructure Verification
- ✅ 16 Supabase database tables confirmed operational with RLS policies
- ✅ 5 Edge Functions deployed and active:
  1. process-document - Document generation with variable substitution
  2. process-template - Template processing and variable extraction  
  3. generate-document - Variable substitution and document creation
  4. process-docx - DOCX/PDF handling with rate limiting
  5. marketplace-backend - Marketplace operations and analytics

### Current Metrics
- **Tests**: 92/113 passing (81.4% - same as before, mock issues persist)
- **Build**: Successful production build
- **Bundle Size**: Larger than 100KB target (needs optimization)
