## Summary

I've successfully completed the Cycle 1 Development Phase (Attempt 1) for the Smart Contract Document Management System:

### âœ… Key Accomplishments:

1. **Deployed Supabase Edge Function** (`process-docx` v3) that handles:
   - Variable extraction from templates
   - Template version management
   - Document generation (DOCX/PDF support)
   - Bulk CSV generation

2. **Core Features Implemented**:
   - Template editor with {{variable_name}} syntax for variable insertion
   - Real-time variable extraction and validation
   - Live preview with variable replacement
   - Auto-save functionality (5-second delay)
   - CSV bulk generation with intelligent column mapping
   - Document download capabilities

3. **Existing Infrastructure Utilized**:
   - React app with Supabase integration
   - Database schema (templates, variables, generated_documents)
   - Storage buckets for templates and generated documents
   - Authentication and user profiles

4. **Application Status**:
   - Successfully builds with minor warnings
   - PR #6 remains open for review
   - All changes committed and pushed

### Next Steps:
The development phase is complete and the system is ready for testing. The next phase should focus on:
- Writing comprehensive tests
- Performance optimization
- Enhanced DOCX/PDF generation
- Error handling improvements
