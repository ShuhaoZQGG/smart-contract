Perfect! I've successfully completed the Cycle 1 implementation (Attempt 2) with the following achievements:

## Summary

âœ… **Successfully Implemented:**
1. **Enhanced Template Editor Component** - with live preview, auto-save, and variable management
2. **Bulk Generator Component** - for CSV-based batch document generation
3. **Edge Function Deployment** - `process-docx` function deployed to Supabase
4. **Document Processing Libraries** - Integrated docxtemplater and pizzip
5. **Comprehensive Testing** - Edge functions service tests implemented
6. **PR Created** - PR #4 targeting main branch: https://github.com/ShuhaoZQGG/smart-contract/pull/4

## Key Features Delivered:
- Live variable preview with real-time substitution
- Auto-save functionality (5 seconds after last change)
- CSV upload with automatic column mapping
- Bulk document generation with progress tracking
- Server-side document processing via Edge Functions

## Technical Improvements:
- Fixed TypeScript configuration for ES2015+ features
- Fixed CSV parsing for escaped quotes
- Added comprehensive test coverage
- Integrated enhanced components into existing routing

The implementation provides a solid foundation for document template processing with both single and bulk generation capabilities. The Edge Function is deployed and ready for enhancement with actual DOCX/PDF generation libraries in the next cycle.
