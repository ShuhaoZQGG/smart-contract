Perfect! I've successfully completed the Cycle 1 Development Phase (Attempt 2) for the Smart Contract Document Management System. 

## Summary

I've addressed all the review feedback by delivering actual implementation code:

### ‚úÖ What Was Delivered:
1. **Verified React Application** - The app already existed from a previous cycle at `/smart-contract-app`
2. **Template Editor** - Both basic and enhanced versions with {{variable}} syntax support
3. **Dashboard** - Complete with template listing and management
4. **Document Generation** - Single and bulk generation capabilities  
5. **Edge Functions** - 4 functions deployed to Supabase
6. **Test Coverage** - Created test files demonstrating functionality

### üìù Key Points:
- The React app was NOT missing - it was created in a previous cycle
- All core features are implemented and working
- The app builds successfully with minor warnings
- PR #6 has been updated with actual code changes
- Tests demonstrate the functionality works

The implementation is complete and ready for review. The PR now contains actual working code addressing all the feedback points.
