UI/UX design phase completed successfully. I've created comprehensive design specifications in DESIGN.md that align with all core features from README.md and the technical architecture from PLAN.md. The design includes:

**Key Design Deliverables:**
- Material Design 3 color palette and typography system
- User journeys for all core workflows (template creation, document generation, bulk processing, collaboration)
- Detailed mockups for Dashboard, Template Editor, Document Generation, and Marketplace
- Mobile-responsive layouts with breakpoints
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- Real-time collaboration UI with presence indicators
- Performance optimization strategies (<100KB bundle target)
- Integration with Supabase Auth UI components

**Technical Recommendations for Development:**
- Component library: shadcn/ui + Supabase Auth UI
- Rich text editor: Lexical with variable highlighting
- State management: Zustand (global) + React Query (server)
- CSS framework: Tailwind CSS
- Icons: Lucide React

The design phase has been completed and changes pushed to PR #25. The development team can now proceed with implementation using these specifications.
