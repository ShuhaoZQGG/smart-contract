Design phase complete! I've created comprehensive UI/UX specifications in DESIGN.md that include:

✅ **Core Features Designed:**
- Template Editor with {{variable}} insertion and syntax highlighting
- Document generation form with validation
- Bulk CSV upload and column mapping interface  
- Dashboard with usage metrics
- Templates library with card layouts
- Mobile responsive designs (375px-1920px)

✅ **Technical Specifications:**
- Supabase Auth UI integration
- Real-time collaboration via WebSocket
- Analytics dashboard with Recharts
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- Performance optimizations (lazy loading, debouncing, skeleton loaders)

✅ **Future Enhancements:**
- Template marketplace interface
- Advanced template logic (IF/THEN conditions)
- Integration capabilities (webhooks, APIs)

The design aligns with all core features from README.md and leverages the existing Supabase backend (5 tables, 4 Edge Functions). Committed to PR #12: https://github.com/ShuhaoZQGG/smart-contract/pull/12
