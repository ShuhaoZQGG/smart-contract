2. **Advanced Variable System** - Added UI designs for conditional logic, computed variables, and lookup fields with dedicated configuration modals

4. **Enhanced Marketplace** - Designed rating/review system, pricing displays, and improved template discovery features

5. **Comment System** - Added threaded comment components for template discussions and feedback

6. **Responsive Design** - Created layouts for mobile (375px) and desktop with bottom navigation for mobile

7. **Accessibility** - Ensured WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and proper contrast ratios

8. **Supabase Integration** - Aligned all designs with the existing 16-table database schema and integrated Supabase Auth UI patterns
