Design phase complete! I've successfully:

1. **Read project requirements** from README.md and PLAN.md
2. **Analyzed Supabase database** structure (16 tables) to align UI with backend
3. **Created comprehensive UI/UX specifications** in DESIGN.md including:
   - Material Design 3 system implementation
   - Complete page layouts for all core features
   - Dashboard, Template Editor, Document Generation interfaces
   - Real-time collaboration views using Supabase Realtime
   - Template Marketplace design
   - Bulk generation workflows
   - Mobile-responsive layouts for all breakpoints
   - WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
   - Integration with Supabase Auth UI components

4. **Updated CYCLE_HANDOFF.md** with design phase completion
5. **Committed and pushed** to existing PR #63

The design fully addresses all core features from README.md and aligns perfectly with the existing Supabase infrastructure, ready for the development phase to implement.
