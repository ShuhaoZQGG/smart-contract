Design phase completed successfully! I've created comprehensive UI/UX specifications in DESIGN.md that fulfill all core features from README.md:

## Completed Design Work:

1. **Core Features Designed**:
   - Document upload and template creation flow
   - Visual editor with Lexical integration and variable system
   - Single and bulk document generation interfaces
   - Template library management
   - Real-time collaboration with presence indicators
   - Template marketplace UI

2. **Cycle 2 Enhanced Features**:
   - **Advanced Variables**: Computed formulas, conditional logic, variable groups
   - **Conflict Resolution**: 3-way merge UI, conflict analytics, auto-resolution options
   - **Commenting System**: Inline comments, @mentions, threaded discussions, notifications
   - **Marketplace Backend**: Admin dashboard, review moderation, revenue analytics
   - **Enterprise Features**: API integration dashboard, team management, permissions matrix

3. **Design Standards**:
   - Material Design 3 inspired system
   - WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
   - Mobile-first responsive design (320px+)
   - Dark mode support
   - Performance optimized with skeleton screens

The design leverages Supabase's capabilities (19 tables with RLS, Auth UI, real-time features) and aligns perfectly with the existing backend infrastructure. All interfaces have been designed to support the document template system's core workflow: Upload → Edit → Generate.

Changes have been committed and pushed to PR #39: https://github.com/ShuhaoZQGG/smart-contract/pull/39
