Design phase complete! Created comprehensive UI/UX specifications for the three critical features:

1. **Advanced Variable System** - Configuration panel with formula editor, conditional logic builder, and validation rules
2. **Conflict Resolution** - 3-way merge dialog with visual diff and smart merge capabilities  
3. **Comment System** - Inline comments with threading, mentions, and resolution tracking

The DESIGN.md includes detailed mockups, user journeys, component hierarchy, accessibility features, and integration points with Supabase. All changes have been committed and pushed to PR #36.
