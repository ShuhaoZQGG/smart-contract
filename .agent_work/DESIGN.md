Design phase completed successfully! I've created comprehensive UI/UX specifications in DESIGN.md covering:

✅ **Design System**: Brand colors, typography, component library (React + Tailwind CSS)
✅ **User Journeys**: First-time, returning, bulk generation, and collaboration flows  
✅ **Page Layouts**: Authentication, dashboard, template editor, document generation, marketplace
✅ **Mobile Responsive**: Optimized layouts for 375px screens
✅ **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with keyboard navigation
✅ **Real-time Collaboration**: Presence indicators and conflict resolution UI
✅ **Performance**: Loading states, skeletons, and auto-save indicators

The design aligns with the Supabase database schema (8 tables with RLS) and emphasizes the Lexical editor for rich text editing with variable insertion. All changes have been committed and pushed to PR #26.
