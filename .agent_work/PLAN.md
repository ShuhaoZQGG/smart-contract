## Planning Phase Complete âœ…

Successfully updated the architectural planning for Cycle 1 continuation. The PLAN.md now focuses on three critical features that build upon the existing foundation:

### Key Architectural Decisions:
1. **Advanced Variable System** - Extending the current {{variable}} syntax with AST-based evaluation for complex logic
2. **Conflict Resolution** - Implementing Yjs CRDT integrated with existing Supabase Realtime
3. **Comment System** - Adding collaboration feedback directly on templates

### Technical Approach:
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Extend existing database schema
- 7-day implementation timeline
- Target >95% test coverage and <100KB bundle size

The planning documents have been committed and pushed to PR #36. The design phase can now proceed with creating UI/UX specifications for these features.
