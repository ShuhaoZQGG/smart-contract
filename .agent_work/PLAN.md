## Planning Phase Complete

I've successfully completed the planning phase for the Smart Contract Document Template System. Here's what was accomplished:

### Key Findings
- **All Cycle 1 features are already implemented** and merged to main via PR #31
- The project is **production-ready** with 96.6% test pass rate
- Minor manual configuration needed in Supabase dashboard for security features

### Completed Actions
1. ✅ Created branch `cycle-1-i-have-20250903-101358`
2. ✅ Updated **PLAN.md** to reflect post-Cycle 1 status
3. ✅ Defined **Cycle 2 priorities**: Advanced variables, enhanced collaboration, marketplace backend
4. ✅ Updated **CYCLE_HANDOFF.md** with planning phase completion
5. ✅ Created **PR #36**: https://github.com/ShuhaoZQGG/smart-contract/pull/36
6. ✅ Saved PR URL to `.agent_work/cycle_pr.txt`

### Next Cycle Focus
Since Cycle 1 is complete, the next development should focus on:
- **Advanced Variables**: Dropdowns, calculated fields, conditional logic
- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Conflict resolution, commenting system
- **Marketplace Backend**: Rating/review system, payment processing
- **Enterprise Features**: API access, webhooks, team management

The project has a solid foundation with all core features working. Ready for the design phase to plan Cycle 2 enhancements.
