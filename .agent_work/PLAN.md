   - Reviewed REVIEW.md confirming successful Cycle 1 completion

### 2. **Created PLAN.md**
   - Comprehensive project architecture and requirements
   - Clear technology stack definition (React + Supabase)
   - Detailed roadmap for Cycles 2-3
   - Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
   - Success metrics and KPIs
   - Supabase integration strategy with MCP tools

### 3. **Git Workflow**

## Key Findings

The project already has a solid foundation from previous Cycle 1 work:
- ✅ 49 tests passing
- ✅ Core document generation working
- ✅ Lexical editor integrated
- ✅ Bundle optimized by 80% (106KB)
- ✅ Supabase backend fully configured

## Next Phase Focus (Cycle 2)
