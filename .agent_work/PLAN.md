Perfect! I have successfully completed the planning phase for Cycle 1 of the smart-contract project. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## Planning Phase Completed ✅

### Key Deliverables:

1. **PLAN.md Created** - Comprehensive architectural plan including:
   - Complete system architecture with Supabase backend
   - 16 database tables designed with RLS policies
   - 5 Edge Functions specified for document processing
   - Technology stack: React 19/TypeScript/Supabase/Lexical
   - Three-phase development roadmap
   - Performance targets and success metrics
   - API specifications and security measures
   - Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

2. **Git Branch Created**: `cycle-1-✅-core-20250904-002925`

3. **Commits Made**:
   - Architectural planning and requirements analysis
   - CYCLE_HANDOFF.md updated with planning phase completion

### Project Architecture Highlights:

- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Realtime, Edge Functions)
- **Frontend**: React 19.0.1, TypeScript 5.3.3, TailwindCSS
- **Document Processing**: mammoth (DOCX), pdf-lib (PDF), docxtemplater
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Supabase Realtime with Yjs CRDT
- **Security**: RLS on all tables, audit logging, rate limiting

### Next Steps for Design Phase:

1. Review existing DESIGN.md for UI/UX specifications
2. Ensure alignment with architectural plan
3. Consider design updates for Cycle 2 features
4. Validate mobile responsiveness requirements

The project is now ready for the design phase, with a solid architectural foundation that leverages Supabase MCP for backend infrastructure and GitHub-personal MCP for version control and collaboration.
