## Planning Phase Complete

I've successfully completed the Cycle 1 planning phase:

### ✅ Completed Tasks
1. **Analyzed existing project state** - Reviewed README, DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION, and REVIEW documents
2. **Updated PLAN.md** - Created comprehensive architectural plan reflecting current implementation status
3. **Created git branch** - `cycle-1-✅-verified-20250903-163604`
4. **Created PR #39** - "Cycle 1: Development Pipeline"
5. **Updated CYCLE_HANDOFF.md** - Documented planning decisions and next steps

### Key Findings
- **Project is already well-developed** with 95.8% test coverage
- **19 database tables** deployed with RLS policies
- **4 Edge Functions** operational
- **Core features complete**: Document management, generation, real-time collaboration, marketplace UI
- **Tech stack**: React 19 + TypeScript + Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Realtime)

### Next Steps for Design Phase
The design phase should focus on:
1. Advanced variable system UI (conditional, calculated fields)
2. Collaboration conflict resolution interface
3. Marketplace backend admin panel
4. Enhanced user journeys for Cycle 2 features
