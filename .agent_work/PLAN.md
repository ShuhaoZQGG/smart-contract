## Planning Phase Complete âœ…

Successfully completed Cycle 1 architectural planning and requirements analysis:

### Completed Tasks
1. **Analyzed Existing Implementation** - Reviewed PRs #25, #29, #30 showing 96.6% test coverage
2. **Updated PLAN.md** - Refined architectural plan with clear development phases
3. **Updated CYCLE_HANDOFF.md** - Documented planning phase completion with technical decisions
4. **Created Git Branch** - `cycle-1-1-verified-20250903-030420`
5. **Created PR #31** - https://github.com/ShuhaoZQGG/smart-contract/pull/31

### Key Findings
- All core features implemented (document generation, processing, collaboration, marketplace UI)
- 16 Supabase tables with RLS policies deployed
- 4 Edge Functions operational
- Bundle size: 107KB (slightly above 100KB target)
- 86/89 tests passing

### Next Steps for Design Phase
The design phase should focus on:
- Reviewing UI implementation against DESIGN.md specs
- Validating mobile responsiveness
- Ensuring accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Identifying any UI/UX gaps

### Security Configuration Required
Manual Supabase dashboard configuration needed for:
- HaveIBeenPwned password protection
- MFA options (TOTP, SMS)
- Password complexity requirements
