## Summary

Planning phase completed successfully! I've:

1. **Analyzed** the existing implementation from previous cycles - found that Cycle 1 core features are complete with 66/69 tests passing
2. **Created PLAN.md** with comprehensive project architecture, requirements, and implementation phases
3. **Identified priorities**:
   - Phase 2: Security hardening (immediate)
   - Phase 3: Advanced features
   - Phase 4: Enterprise capabilities
4. **Created PR #26**: "Cycle 1: Development Pipeline" 
5. **Updated CYCLE_HANDOFF.md** with completed work and next steps

**Key Decisions:**
- Focus on security hardening as immediate priority (MFA, rate limiting, audit logging)
- Optimize bundle size to <100KB target (currently 107KB)
- Use CRDT for collaboration conflict resolution
- Maintain Supabase as backend infrastructure

**PR URL:** https://github.com/ShuhaoZQGG/smart-contract/pull/26

The project has a solid foundation. Next phase should focus on security configuration before adding new features.
