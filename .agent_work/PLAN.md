## Planning Phase Complete

Successfully completed Cycle 1 planning phase:

### âœ… Accomplished
1. **Analyzed Documentation** - Reviewed README, previous implementation, and review feedback
2. **Updated PLAN.md** - Comprehensive architectural plan aligned with current implementation
3. **Updated CYCLE_HANDOFF.md** - Documented planning decisions and next steps
4. **Created PR #12** - "Cycle 1: Development Pipeline" 
   - URL: https://github.com/ShuhaoZQGG/smart-contract/pull/12
   - Branch: cycle-1-cycle-1-20250902-134531

### Key Findings
- Cycle 1 implementation already complete with 49 tests passing
- Supabase fully integrated (5 tables, 4 Edge Functions)
- Core features functional (document processing, variable substitution, bulk generation)
- Minor optimizations needed (bundle size, test coverage)

### Next Steps for Design Phase
- Real-time collaboration UI design
- Template marketplace interface
- Analytics dashboard wireframes
- Performance optimization planning

The architectural plan is ready to guide continued development of the smart-contract document template system.
