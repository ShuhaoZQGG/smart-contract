=== UI-FEATURE-DESIGNER PHASE - Tue  2 Sep 2025 13:30:12 EDT ===
Design phase complete! I've created comprehensive UI/UX specifications in DESIGN.md that:

1. **Fulfills ALL core features from README.md** - Every feature has corresponding UI designs
2. **Aligns with Supabase backend** - Leveraged MCP to understand database schema and designed UI accordingly
3. **Provides complete design system** - Colors, typography, spacing, components
4. **Detailed mockups** - Dashboard, template editor, document generator, bulk generation
5. **Mobile responsive** - Breakpoints and mobile-specific layouts
6. **Accessibility-first** - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance specifications
7. **Performance optimized** - Loading states, animations, caching strategies
8. **Dark mode support** - Complete color scheme adaptation

The design has been committed to the existing PR #11 with message: 'feat(cycle-1): UI/UX design specifications'

Key design decisions:
- Shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS for consistent components
- Variable highlighting with visual feedback
