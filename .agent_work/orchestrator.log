### Next Steps for Design Phase

The project is ready for the design phase to create UI/UX specifications for any missing interfaces and document the component hierarchy based on the existing implementation.
RESULT: Architecture planning completed successfully

=== UI-FEATURE-DESIGNER PHASE - Wed  3 Sep 2025 09:17:31 EDT ===
Design phase completed successfully! I've created comprehensive UI/UX specifications in DESIGN.md that fulfill all core features from README.md. The design includes:

âœ… **Completed Tasks:**
- Material Design 3 based design system with responsive layouts
- User journeys for template creation, document generation, and bulk processing
- Detailed page mockups for Dashboard, Template Editor, Generation Form, and Marketplace
- Component specifications with accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Integration points with Supabase Auth and backend services
- Performance optimization strategies
- Mobile-responsive design with appropriate breakpoints

The changes have been committed and pushed to PR #31. The project is now ready for the development phase where the UI components will be implemented based on these design specifications.
RESULT: UI/UX design completed successfully
