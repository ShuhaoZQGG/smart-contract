- Code splitting (bundle: 546KB → 107KB)
- Lazy loading implementation
- Auto-save functionality
- Comprehensive skeleton loaders

### Cycle 2 Features (Complete)
✅ **Real-time Collaboration**
- WebSocket implementation via Supabase Realtime
- Presence tracking for active collaborators
- Live editing capabilities
- CollaborationPresence component
- TemplateEditorCollaborative component
- useRealtimeCollaboration hook

✅ **Template Marketplace**
- Full marketplace UI with filtering
- Template cloning functionality
- Category and tag filtering
- Rating display system
- Search capabilities

### Testing & Quality
- 66 tests passing (7 test suites)
- 3 tests skipped (auth requirements)
- 1 test suite with mocking issues (non-critical)
- Build successful
- Bundle size: 107KB gzipped

## Pending Items
### High Priority (Security)
- Enable leaked password protection in Supabase Auth
- Configure additional MFA options (TOTP, SMS)

### Medium Priority (Next Cycle)
- Complete marketplace backend integration
- Add conflict resolution for simultaneous edits
- Implement commenting system on templates
- Optimize bundle to <100KB target

### Low Priority
- Fix Jest mocking for Supabase client tests
- Clean up unused database indexes
- Add E2E testing for collaboration features
- Implement advanced variable types

## Technical Decisions
- React 18.3 + TypeScript + Supabase stack confirmed
- Lexical editor successfully integrated
- Supabase Realtime for WebSocket features
- Shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS for UI
- Zustand + React Query for state management

## Known Issues
### Non-Critical
- Jest mocking issues with Supabase client (tests only)
- 12 unused indexes in database (performance advisors)
- Bundle size at 107KB (target: <100KB)

### Configuration Needed
- Supabase Auth security settings need update
- Rate limiting not yet configured on Edge Functions

## Next Steps for Cycle 3
With Cycles 1 & 2 COMPLETE and MERGED, ready for:

### Immediate Actions (Security Critical)
1. Configure Supabase Auth security settings
   - Enable leaked password protection
   - Add MFA options (TOTP, SMS)

### Cycle 3 Development Focus
1. **Advanced Collaboration**
   - Conflict resolution for simultaneous edits
   - Commenting system on templates
   - Version control and rollback
   
2. **Marketplace Backend**
   - Rating and review system implementation
