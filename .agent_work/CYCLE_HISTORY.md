#### Handoff Notes
## Completed Work
<!-- Updated by each agent as they complete their phase -->
- **Review**: Completed with decision: APPROVED
- **Development**: Database performance and security optimizations (attempt 3)
- **Review**: Approved and merged PR #5 to main branch

### Key Achievements:
- ✅ Fixed all RLS policy performance issues (14 WARN resolved)
- ✅ Resolved security vulnerability in update_updated_at function
- ✅ Optimized database indexes (added 3, removed 5)
- ✅ Removed 40+ duplicate policies
- ✅ Achieved 0 security warnings

## Pending Items
<!-- Items that need attention in the next phase or cycle -->
- Feature development: DOCX/PDF generation libraries
- Template marketplace implementation
- Real-time collaboration features
- UI/UX enhancements with Shadcn components

## Technical Decisions
<!-- Important technical decisions made during this cycle -->
- Used `(select auth.uid())` pattern for all RLS policies
- Consolidated duplicate policies for better performance
- Set explicit search_path for security functions
- Removed unused indexes to reduce overhead

## Known Issues
<!-- Issues discovered but not yet resolved -->
- 5 INFO level advisories (non-critical):
  - 2 unindexed foreign keys (acceptable for current traffic)
  - 3 unused indexes (normal for new application)

## Next Steps
<!-- Clear action items for the next agent/cycle -->
1. Start next cycle from fresh main branch
2. Focus on feature development
3. Integrate actual document processing libraries
4. Implement marketplace features
