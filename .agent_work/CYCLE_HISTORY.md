- **Review**: Completed with decision: APPROVED
- **Development**: Implemented features with TDD (attempt 2)
- **Review**: PR #8 reviewed and APPROVED
- **Merge**: PR #8 successfully merged to main branch

### Development Phase (Attempt 2 - Completed)
- **Fixed all build issues** from previous review
- **Created core utilities:**
  - `documentGenerator.ts` - Variable substitution and document generation
  - `documentGenerator.test.ts` - Comprehensive test coverage (38 tests)
  - `documentProcessor.ts` - Document format processing with libraries
- **Integrated document processing libraries:**
  - mammoth for DOCX text extraction
  - pdf-lib for PDF generation
  - docxtemplater with pizzip for template processing
- **Fixed testing issues:**
  - Resolved React Router DOM mocking in App.test.tsx
  - All tests passing (38 passed, 1 skipped)

- Version history UI

## Technical Decisions
<!-- Important technical decisions made during this cycle -->
- Used mammoth for DOCX text extraction (lightweight and reliable)

- Created modular utilities for separation of concerns

## Known Issues
<!-- Issues discovered but not yet resolved -->

- CSV parser needs enhancement for more complex formats
- PDF generation needs better formatting options

## Review Phase Summary
- **Decision**: APPROVED ✅
- **PR Merged**: #8 merged to main via squash
- **Security**: No vulnerabilities found
- **Performance**: Minor INFO-level advisories only
- **Tests**: 38 passing, build successful
- **Next Cycle Focus**: UI integration and user experience

## Next Steps
<!-- Clear action items for the next agent/cycle -->
1. ✅ **Review Phase:** PR #8 reviewed and approved
2. ✅ **Merge**: PR #8 merged to main branch
