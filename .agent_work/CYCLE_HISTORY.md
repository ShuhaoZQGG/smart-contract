  - `documentProcessor.ts` - Document format processing with libraries
- **Integrated document processing libraries:**
  - mammoth for DOCX text extraction
  - pdf-lib for PDF generation
  - docxtemplater with pizzip for template processing
- **Fixed testing issues:**
  - Resolved React Router DOM mocking in App.test.tsx
