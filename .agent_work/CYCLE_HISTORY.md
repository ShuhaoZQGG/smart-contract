- **Review**: Completed with decision: APPROVED
- **Development**: Implemented features with TDD (attempt 2)
- **Review**: PR #8 reviewed and APPROVED
- **Merge**: PR #8 successfully merged to main branch

### Development Phase (Attempt 2 - Completed)
- **Fixed all build issues** from previous review
- **Created core utilities:**
  - `documentGenerator.ts` - Variable substitution and document generation

  - `documentProcessor.ts` - Document format processing with libraries
- **Integrated document processing libraries:**
  - mammoth for DOCX text extraction
  - pdf-lib for PDF generation
