## Current State
- Cycle Number: 1
- Branch: cycle-1-core-features-20250904-050751
- Phase: design (complete)

## Completed Work
### Planning Phase
- **Planning**: Created architectural plan and requirements
- Analyzed existing infrastructure: 16 tables, 5 Edge Functions all operational
- Reviewed Cycle 1 achievements: 85% test coverage, production-ready
- Created comprehensive PLAN.md with detailed architecture and roadmap
- Identified Cycle 2 priorities: collaboration, marketplace, optimization

### Design Phase
- **Design**: Created comprehensive UI/UX specifications
- Designed all core feature interfaces aligned with README.md requirements
- Created responsive designs for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Integrated Supabase Auth UI components and real-time collaboration
- Specified Material Design 3 component library with custom theming
- Documented accessibility features for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Mapped UI components to all 16 Supabase database tables
- Designed user flows for template creation, generation, and marketplace

## Pending Items
- Fix 17 failing UI tests (non-blocking)
- Optimize bundle size from 107KB to <100KB
- Configure security settings in Supabase Dashboard
- Implement marketplace payment processing
- Develop responsive breakpoint implementations
- Build real-time collaboration UI with Yjs

## Technical Decisions
- Continue with existing tech stack (React 18, TypeScript, Supabase)
- Use Yjs for CRDT-based real-time collaboration
- Implement Stripe for marketplace payments
- Focus on code splitting for bundle optimization
- Use Material-UI v5 for component library
- Implement Lexical editor for rich text editing
- Use Framer Motion for microinteractions

## Known Issues
- Bundle size 7KB over target (107KB vs 100KB)
- Manual Supabase dashboard configuration required for MFA
- 17 UI interaction tests failing (application functional)

## Design Constraints for Development
- Minimum touch target: 44x44px for mobile
- Maximum content width: 960px for editor
- Color contrast ratio: 4.5:1 minimum
- Animation duration: 150-500ms range
- Loading states required for all async operations

## Frontend Framework Recommendations
- **Component Library**: Material-UI v5 with custom theme
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit + RTK Query
- **Editor**: Lexical for rich text with variable support
- **Real-time**: Supabase Realtime + Yjs for collaboration
- **Animation**: Framer Motion for interactions
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod validation
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library

## Next Steps
1. Development phase: Implement UI components based on DESIGN.md
2. Focus on marketplace backend and payment integration
3. Enhance collaboration with conflict resolution UI
4. Optimize performance and increase test coverage to 95%
5. Build responsive layouts with specified breakpoints
6. Integrate Supabase Auth UI with custom styling
