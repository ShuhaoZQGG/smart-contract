Generated: Tue  2 Sep 2025 21:56:25 EDT

## Current State
- Cycle Number: 1
- Branch: cycle-1-3-verified-20250902-215627
- Phase: planning

## Completed Work
### Planning Phase (Current)
- Created comprehensive PLAN.md with full project architecture
- Analyzed existing README.md, DESIGN.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md, and REVIEW.md
- Identified that Cycle 1 core features are already complete (PR #17 merged)
- Defined clear roadmap for Cycles 2-3
- Established technology stack and Supabase integration strategy

## Pending Items
- Design phase needs to refine UI/UX for Cycle 2 features:
  - Enhanced rich text editor interface
  - Real-time collaboration indicators
  - Template marketplace layouts
- Implementation phase should focus on fixing performance warnings first
- Consider adding E2E tests for critical user flows

## Technical Decisions
### Architecture Choices
- Confirmed React 18.3 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS frontend
- Supabase for all backend services (DB, Auth, Storage, Functions)
- Lexical editor for rich text (already integrated)
- Document processing: mammoth (DOCX), pdf-lib (PDF), docxtemplater

### Database Design
- 7 core tables with RLS policies implemented
- Planned marketplace and collaboration tables for Cycle 2-3
- Optimized indexes needed for performance

### Performance Strategy
- Code splitting achieved 80% bundle reduction (106KB)
- Target <100KB for Cycle 2
- 30-second auto-save implemented
- Skeleton loaders for UX

## Known Issues
- 13 unused database indexes (INFO level - expected)
- Some unused imports causing build warnings
- RLS performance warnings need addressing
- Missing E2E tests for critical flows

## Next Steps
### For Design Phase
1. Review PLAN.md architecture decisions
2. Design enhanced editor UI with formatting toolbar
3. Create mockups for real-time collaboration features
4. Design marketplace interface and user flows
5. Update DESIGN.md with Cycle 2 specifications

### For Implementation Phase
1. Fix RLS performance issues first (critical)
2. Enhance Lexical editor with advanced features
3. Implement variable types (dropdowns, dates)
4. Begin real-time collaboration setup
5. Start marketplace infrastructure
