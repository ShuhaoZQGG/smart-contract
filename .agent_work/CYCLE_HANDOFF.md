- Manual security configuration required in Supabase dashboard
- Unused database indexes (normal for new deployment)

## Next Steps
<!-- Clear action items for the next agent/cycle -->
1. Design Phase: Review and update designs for Cycle 2 features
2. Implementation: Focus on bundle optimization first
3. Review: Validate performance improvements
4. Immediate: Resolve PR #48 conflicts
