Generated: Wed  3 Sep 2025 09:33:22 EDT

## Current State
- Cycle Number: 1
- Branch: cycle-1-successfully-verified-20250903-093322
- Phase: Design Complete → Ready for Development

## Completed Work
### Planning Phase ✅
- **Design**: Created UI/UX specifications and mockups
- **Planning**: Created architectural plan and requirements
- Comprehensive architectural plan created in PLAN.md
- Analyzed existing implementation from previous cycles (PR #31 merged)
- Identified completed features vs remaining work
- Defined clear technology stack and architecture
- Created detailed implementation roadmap

### Design Phase ✅
- **Design**: Created comprehensive UI/UX specifications
- Updated DESIGN.md with all core features from README.md
- Designed interfaces for advanced variable types (conditional, computed, lookup)
- Created conflict resolution dialog for real-time collaboration
- Enhanced template marketplace with rating/review system
- Added comment thread component for template discussions
- Designed responsive layouts for mobile (375px) and desktop
- Specified accessibility features (WCAG 2.1 AA compliant)
- Integrated Supabase Auth UI components
- Aligned designs with existing 16-table database schema

## Pending Items
### For Development Phase
- Implement UI components based on DESIGN.md specifications
- Build advanced variable system (conditional, computed, lookup)
- Integrate conflict resolution with Supabase Realtime
- Implement marketplace rating/review backend
- Add comment system with thread support
- Optimize bundle size below 100KB target
- Fix remaining 3 test failures

### Security Configuration (Manual Dashboard Action Required)
- Enable HaveIBeenPwned password protection
- Configure additional MFA options (TOTP, SMS)
- These cannot be done via API/MCP

## Technical Decisions
### Architecture Choices
- **Frontend**: React 18.3 + TypeScript + Lexical Editor (confirmed)
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions)
- **Real-time**: Supabase Realtime channels for collaboration
- **Document Processing**: mammoth.js, pdf-lib, docxtemplater
- **State Management**: Zustand + React Query

### Database Design
- 16 tables already deployed with RLS policies
- 4 Edge Functions active and operational
- Authentication and storage configured
- Real-time collaboration infrastructure in place

### Performance Targets
- Bundle size: <100KB (currently 107KB)
- Initial load: <2s (currently 1.5s)
- Test coverage: >95% (currently 96.6%)

## Known Issues
### Non-Critical
- Bundle size 7KB over target (107KB vs 100KB)
- 3 tests skipped (auth-related mocking issues)
- 12 unused database indexes (monitoring before removal)

### Requires Manual Action
- Supabase Auth security settings (dashboard only)
- Rate limiting configuration for Edge Functions

## Technical Constraints for Development
### Frontend Framework
- React 18.3 with TypeScript
- Lexical Editor for rich text
- Shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS
- Zustand state management
- React Query for server state

### Design System
- Primary: #2563EB, Secondary: #10B981, Accent: #F59E0B
- Inter font for UI, Monaco for code
- 8px rounded corners (12px for cards)
- Material Design 3 principles

## Next Steps
### For Development Agent
1. Implement advanced variable types
2. Add conflict resolution with OT/CRDT
3. Build marketplace backend with ratings
4. Integrate comment system
5. Optimize bundle size below 100KB
