## Current State
- Cycle Number: 1 (Continuation - Cycle 2 Architecture Planning)
- Branch: cycle-1-all-core-20250904-014216
- Phase: planning (Cycle 2 architecture complete)

## Completed Work
<!-- Updated by each agent as they complete their phase -->

### Planning Phase (Cycle 2 Architecture) - COMPLETE
- ✅ Analyzed current infrastructure status via Supabase MCP
- ✅ Verified all 16 database tables operational with RLS
- ✅ Confirmed 5 Edge Functions deployed and active
- ✅ Created comprehensive Cycle 2 architectural plan
- ✅ Defined 4-week implementation roadmap
- ✅ Specified monetization strategy with Stripe integration
- ✅ Designed enterprise feature architecture
- ✅ Planned advanced variable system enhancements

### Key Architectural Decisions Made
1. **Performance Optimization**: Bundle size reduction strategy (<100KB)
2. **Monetization**: 70/30 revenue split, Stripe payment processing
3. **Enterprise Features**: API tiers, webhook system, team management
4. **Advanced Variables**: Conditional, computed, and external data sources
5. **Scalability**: Multi-layer caching, CDN, database optimization

## Pending Items
<!-- Items that need attention in the next phase or cycle -->

### Immediate Actions Required
1. Configure Supabase security settings via dashboard (manual)
2. Fix 18 test mock failures for Supabase methods
3. Optimize bundle size from 107KB to <100KB
4. Merge PR #48 and resolve conflicts

### Week 1 Priorities
- Bundle optimization and code splitting
- Test infrastructure improvements
- Security configuration in Supabase dashboard
- Performance metrics setup

## Technical Decisions
<!-- Important technical decisions made during this cycle -->

### Database Schema Extensions
- `template_pricing` table for monetization
- `transactions` table for payment tracking
- `revenue_shares` table for creator payouts
- `teams` and `team_members` tables for collaboration
- `team_templates` table for shared access control

### New Edge Functions Planned
- `payment-processor` for Stripe integration
- `webhook-delivery` for reliable webhook dispatch
- `api-gateway` for rate-limited API access

### Technology Stack Additions
- **Payments**: Stripe Checkout, Payment Intents
- **Monitoring**: Sentry, Mixpanel, Datadog
- **Caching**: Cloudflare Edge, Redis
- **CDN**: Cloudflare for document delivery

## Known Issues
<!-- Issues discovered but not yet resolved -->

1. **Bundle Size**: Currently 107KB (7KB over target)
2. **Test Failures**: 18 mock-related failures (non-critical)
3. **Security Config**: Requires manual dashboard configuration
4. **PR Conflicts**: PR #48 needs conflict resolution

## Next Steps
<!-- Clear action items for the next agent/cycle -->

### For Design Phase Agent
1. Review Cycle 2 architectural plan in PLAN.md
2. Design UI/UX for payment flows and monetization
3. Create enterprise dashboard mockups
4. Design advanced variable configuration interface
5. Update DESIGN.md with Cycle 2 specifications

### For Implementation Phase Agent
1. Begin bundle optimization work immediately
2. Implement Stripe integration Edge Function
3. Create team management database migrations
4. Build advanced variable system
5. Deploy payment processing infrastructure

### For Review Phase Agent
1. Verify all Cycle 2 requirements met
2. Test payment flows end-to-end
3. Validate enterprise features
4. Performance test at scale
5. Security audit new features

## Success Criteria for Cycle 2
- Bundle size <100KB
- 100% test pass rate
- Payment processing functional
- 5 new Edge Functions deployed
- 6 new database tables created
- API gateway operational
- Webhook system reliable
- Team features complete

## Infrastructure Status Summary
```
Database Tables: 16/16 operational ✅
Edge Functions: 5/5 active ✅
Authentication: Configured ✅
Storage: Operational ✅
Realtime: WebSocket active ✅
Tests: 92/113 passing (81.4%)
Bundle: 107KB (target <100KB)
```

## Risk Mitigation Notes
- Supabase rate limits: Implement caching layer
- Payment compliance: Legal review required
- Bundle size: Aggressive code splitting needed
- Test coverage: Focus on mock improvements

## Handoff Complete
Planning phase for Cycle 2 architecture successfully completed. Comprehensive technical plan delivered in PLAN.md with clear implementation roadmap, technology decisions, and success metrics. Ready for design phase to create UI/UX for new features.
