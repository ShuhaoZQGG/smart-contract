# Cycle 1 Handoff Document

Generated: Wed  3 Sep 2025 09:33:22 EDT

## Current State
- Cycle Number: 1
- Branch: cycle-1-successfully-verified-20250903-093322
- Phase: Planning Complete → Ready for Design

## Completed Work
### Planning Phase ✅
- Comprehensive architectural plan created in PLAN.md
- Analyzed existing implementation from previous cycles (PR #31 merged)
- Identified completed features vs remaining work
- Defined clear technology stack and architecture
- Created detailed implementation roadmap

## Pending Items
### For Design Phase
- Review existing DESIGN.md for alignment with updated plan
- Ensure UI/UX specifications cover new Cycle 2 features:
  - Advanced variable types UI (dropdown, date, calculated)
  - Conflict resolution interface for collaboration
  - Marketplace backend integration points
  - Comment system design

### Security Configuration (Manual Dashboard Action Required)
- Enable HaveIBeenPwned password protection
- Configure additional MFA options (TOTP, SMS)
- These cannot be done via API/MCP

## Technical Decisions
### Architecture Choices
- **Frontend**: React 18.3 + TypeScript + Lexical Editor (confirmed)
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions)
- **Real-time**: Supabase Realtime channels for collaboration
- **Document Processing**: mammoth.js, pdf-lib, docxtemplater
- **State Management**: Zustand + React Query

### Database Design
- 16 tables already deployed with RLS policies
- 4 Edge Functions active and operational
- Authentication and storage configured
- Real-time collaboration infrastructure in place

### Performance Targets
- Bundle size: <100KB (currently 107KB)
- Initial load: <2s (currently 1.5s)
- Test coverage: >95% (currently 96.6%)

## Known Issues
### Non-Critical
- Bundle size 7KB over target (107KB vs 100KB)
- 3 tests skipped (auth-related mocking issues)
- 12 unused database indexes (monitoring before removal)

### Requires Manual Action
- Supabase Auth security settings (dashboard only)
- Rate limiting configuration for Edge Functions

## Next Steps
### For Design Agent
1. Review and update DESIGN.md for Cycle 2 features
2. Design interfaces for:
   - Advanced variable type selectors
   - Conflict resolution dialogs
   - Marketplace rating/review system
   - Comment threads on templates
3. Consider mobile experience for new features
4. Ensure accessibility standards maintained

### For Development Agent (After Design)
1. Implement advanced variable types
2. Add conflict resolution with OT/CRDT
3. Build marketplace backend with ratings
4. Integrate comment system
5. Optimize bundle size below 100KB
