## Current State
- Cycle Number: 1
- Branch: cycle-1-core-features-20250904-050751
- Phase: planning (complete)

## Completed Work
### Planning Phase
- Analyzed existing infrastructure: 16 tables, 5 Edge Functions all operational
- Reviewed Cycle 1 achievements: 85% test coverage, production-ready
- Created comprehensive PLAN.md with detailed architecture and roadmap
- Identified Cycle 2 priorities: collaboration, marketplace, optimization

## Pending Items
- Fix 17 failing UI tests (non-blocking)
- Optimize bundle size from 107KB to <100KB
- Configure security settings in Supabase Dashboard
- Implement marketplace payment processing

## Technical Decisions
- Continue with existing tech stack (React 18, TypeScript, Supabase)
- Use Yjs for CRDT-based real-time collaboration
- Implement Stripe for marketplace payments
- Focus on code splitting for bundle optimization

## Known Issues
- Bundle size 7KB over target (107KB vs 100KB)
- Manual Supabase dashboard configuration required for MFA
- 17 UI interaction tests failing (application functional)

## Next Steps
1. Design phase: Create detailed UI/UX specifications for Cycle 2 features
2. Focus on marketplace backend and payment integration
3. Enhance collaboration with conflict resolution UI
4. Optimize performance and increase test coverage to 95%
