## Current State
- Cycle Number: 1
- Branch: cycle-1-✅-verified-20250902-232552
- Phase: planning (complete)
- PR URL: https://github.com/ShuhaoZQGG/smart-contract/pull/23

## Completed Work
<!-- Updated by each agent as they complete their phase -->
- **Design**: Created UI/UX specifications and mockups
- **Planning**: Created architectural plan and requirements
### Planning Phase ✅
- Comprehensive architectural planning completed in PLAN.md
- Requirements analyzed from vision and existing documentation
- Technical stack confirmed: React/TypeScript + Supabase
- Database schema designed for all features
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies defined
- Development phases outlined with clear priorities

### Design Phase ✅
- Comprehensive UI/UX specifications created in DESIGN.md
- Visual identity defined: Color palette, typography, spacing system
- User journeys mapped for all core features
- Detailed wireframes for 6 main interfaces:
  - Authentication (Supabase Auth integration)
  - Dashboard with analytics
  - Template Editor with Lexical rich text
  - Document Generation (single & bulk)
  - Template Marketplace
- Mobile responsive designs specified
- Component architecture defined with shadcn/ui
- Accessibility WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- Real-time collaboration UI patterns
- Performance optimizations planned

## Pending Items
<!-- Items that need attention in the next phase or cycle -->
### For Development Phase
- Implement shadcn/ui component library with custom theme
- Build Lexical editor with variable highlighting
- Integrate Supabase Realtime for collaboration
- Implement template marketplace UI components
- Add auto-save functionality (30-second intervals)
- Create responsive mobile views
- Implement skeleton loaders and loading states

### Security Configuration
- Configure Supabase Auth MFA settings
- Implement password policies
- Set up rate limiting

## Technical Decisions
<!-- Important technical decisions made during this cycle -->
1. **Supabase Infrastructure**: Full stack (Auth, DB, Storage, Realtime, Edge Functions)
2. **Lexical Editor**: Superior performance for rich text editing
3. **Edge Functions**: Serverless document processing for scalability
4. **React + TypeScript**: Type safety and modern DX
5. **Vite Build**: Optimized bundling, faster than CRA
6. **shadcn/ui**: Modern, accessible component library
7. **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling approach
8. **Lucide React**: Consistent icon system

## Known Issues
<!-- Issues discovered but not yet resolved -->
- Supabase Auth security warnings (MFA, password policies) - minor configuration needed
- No critical blockers identified

## Next Steps
<!-- Clear action items for the next agent/cycle -->
1. Design agent should refine UI/UX specifications
2. Create component architecture diagrams
3. Detail collaboration conflict resolution approach
4. Plan marketplace backend architecture
5. Consider adding E2E test specifications
