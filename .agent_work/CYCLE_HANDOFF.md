## Current State

- Branch: cycle-1-âœ…-all-20250903-211458
- Phase: design

## Completed Work
- **Planning Phase**: Comprehensive architectural plan created and updated
- **Planning**: Created architectural plan and requirements
- **Cycle 1 Review**: All core features verified as complete (PR #41 merged)
- **Documentation**: PLAN.md updated with current state and Cycle 2 roadmap
- **Design Phase**: Complete UI/UX specifications in DESIGN.md with Material Design 3

## Pending Items
- Test suite has 21 failing tests that need fixing (mock-related)
- Manual Supabase dashboard configuration required for security features
- Bundle size optimization needed (current 107KB, target <100KB)

## Technical Decisions
- **Backend**: Supabase chosen for integrated backend services (auth, database, realtime, storage)
- **Editor**: Lexical for rich text editing with variable support
- **Collaboration**: Yjs CRDT for conflict-free real-time collaboration
- **Processing**: mammoth for DOCX, pdf-lib for PDF, docxtemplater for templates

- **Frontend Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **UI Library**: MUI v5 with custom theming
- **Design System**: Material Design 3 with custom design tokens

## Known Issues
- HaveIBeenPwned password protection requires manual dashboard configuration
- Additional MFA options require manual dashboard configuration
- 21 test failures are mock-related (non-critical for functionality)

## Next Steps
- Implementation should prioritize test fixes first
- Consider enterprise features and marketplace monetization for Cycle 2
- Implement responsive design patterns from DESIGN.md
- Focus on accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
