- Add Shadcn/ui component library for better UI
- Enhance variable extraction from uploaded documents
- Add template versioning UI
- Implement download functionality for generated documents
- Add unit and integration tests
- Setup CI/CD pipeline
- Deploy to Vercel

## Technical Decisions
<!-- Important technical decisions made during this cycle -->
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions)
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript
- **Document Processing**: Python-docx for DOCX, PDFKit for PDF
- **Deployment**: Vercel (Frontend) + Supabase (Backend)
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage for document files
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Row Level Security
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS

- **Tables**: Tanstack Table for data grids
- **Design System**: Inter font, Blue/Green/Purple color scheme
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

## Known Issues
<!-- Issues discovered but not yet resolved -->
- Document processing currently saves as plain text (need actual DOCX/PDF libraries)
- Variable extraction needs improvement for uploaded documents
- Download functionality not yet implemented
- No test coverage

## Next Steps
<!-- Clear action items for the next agent/cycle -->
1. Integrate document processing libraries (python-docx, pdf-lib)
2. Improve variable extraction from uploaded documents
3. Add download functionality for generated documents
4. Implement Shadcn/ui components for better UI
5. Add comprehensive test coverage
6. Deploy to production (Vercel + Supabase)
