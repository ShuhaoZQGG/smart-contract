## Current State
- Cycle Number: 1 (Continuation)
- Branch: cycle-1-i-have-20250903-101358
- Phase: design (COMPLETE)
- PR: #36 (Active)

## Completed Work
### Planning Phase ✅
- **Planning**: Created architectural plan and requirements
- Analyzed existing implementation from PR #31 (merged)
- Identified 3 critical features for Cycle 1 continuation:
  1. Advanced Variable System
  2. Conflict Resolution (Yjs CRDT)
  3. Comment System
- Updated PLAN.md with architectural decisions
- Defined implementation strategy (7-day timeline)

### Design Phase ✅
- **UI/UX Specifications**: Created comprehensive designs
- Advanced variable configuration panel with formula editor
- Conflict resolution dialog with 3-way merge UI
- Inline comment system with thread management
- Mobile-responsive layouts (320px - 1440px)
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- Component hierarchy defined for all 3 features
- Integration points with Supabase backend documented

## Pending Items
### For Development Phase
- Implement advanced variable AST evaluation
- Integrate Yjs CRDT with Supabase Realtime
- Build comment system with line tracking
- Ensure <100KB bundle size target
- Achieve >95% test coverage

## Technical Decisions
1. **Variable Enhancement**: AST-based evaluation for complex logic
2. **Collaboration**: Yjs CRDT with Supabase Realtime transport
3. **Database**: Extend existing schema (no breaking changes)
4. **Dependencies**: Add yjs, y-lexical for CRDT support

## Known Issues
- 3 tests failing (from previous cycle)
- Bundle size at 107KB (7KB over target)
- Manual Supabase configuration needed for security

## Next Steps
### Development Phase Requirements
1. Set up Yjs and y-lexical dependencies
2. Implement AdvancedVariableSystem components
3. Build ConflictResolution with CRDT integration
4. Create CommentSystem with thread management
5. Write comprehensive tests (>95% coverage)
6. Optimize bundle size (<100KB target)
