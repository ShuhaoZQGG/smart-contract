## Current State
- Cycle Number: 1
- Branch: cycle-1-i-have-20250903-101358
- Phase: planning (completed)

## Completed Work
- **Planning Phase**: Comprehensive architectural planning completed
  - Analyzed existing implementation from PR #31 (merged to main)
  - Identified that all Cycle 1 features are already complete
  - Updated PLAN.md to reflect post-Cycle 1 status
  - Defined Cycle 2 priorities and enhancements

## Pending Items
- Manual Supabase dashboard configuration required:
  - Enable HaveIBeenPwned password protection
  - Configure additional MFA options
  - Set password complexity requirements

## Technical Decisions
- All core features from Cycle 1 are implemented and merged (PR #31)
- Project is ready for Cycle 2 enhancements:
  - Advanced variable types (dropdowns, calculated fields)
  - Enhanced collaboration (conflict resolution)
  - Marketplace backend implementation
  - Enterprise features (API, webhooks)

## Known Issues
- Bundle size at 107KB (7KB over target but acceptable)
- 3 tests skipped (auth-related, non-critical)
- Security configurations need manual setup in Supabase dashboard

## Next Steps
- Design phase should focus on Cycle 2 features
- Consider advanced variable UI/UX design
- Plan marketplace monetization flow
- Design enterprise dashboard
