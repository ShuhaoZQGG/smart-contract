## Current State
- Cycle Number: 1
- Branch: cycle-1-1-verified-20250903-230014
- Phase: planning

## Completed Work
<!-- HANDOFF_START -->
- **Planning**: Created architectural plan and requirements
### Planning Phase Complete
- ✅ Analyzed existing project implementation and requirements
- ✅ Verified database infrastructure (16 tables with RLS policies)
- ✅ Created comprehensive architectural plan in PLAN.md
- ✅ Aligned plan with README.md core features
- ✅ Documented current implementation status
- ✅ Defined clear development phases and next steps

### Design Phase Complete
- ✅ Created comprehensive UI/UX specifications in DESIGN.md
- ✅ Designed all core feature interfaces (Dashboard, Editor, Generation, Library, Bulk)
- ✅ Specified Material Design 3 system with accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- ✅ Mapped user journeys for all core workflows
- ✅ Created mobile-responsive designs for all screens
- ✅ Defined real-time collaboration UI with conflict resolution
- ✅ Designed marketplace and template gallery interfaces
- ✅ Recommended React 18 + TypeScript + Material-UI stack
<!-- HANDOFF_END -->

## Pending Items
### For Implementation Phase
- Fix remaining test failures (currently 81.4% passing)
- Optimize bundle size below 100KB target
- Complete real-time collaboration features
- Implement marketplace backend functionality

## Technical Decisions
### Design Constraints for Development
- **Component Library**: Use Material-UI v5 for consistency
- **Editor Framework**: Lexical for rich text editing (already integrated)
- **Variable Syntax**: {{variable_name}} format (established pattern)
- **Mobile Breakpoints**: 375px (mobile), 768px (tablet), 1024px+ (desktop)
- **Color System**: Material Design 3 dynamic theming
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance required

### Major Architecture Choices
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Supabase (16 tables implemented)
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript and Lexical editor
- **Backend**: Supabase Edge Functions for serverless processing
- **Real-time**: WebSocket via Supabase Realtime
- **Document Processing**: mammoth (DOCX), pdf-lib (PDF), docxtemplater
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with MFA support
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage for documents and templates

### Infrastructure Status
- 16 database tables created with proper relationships
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- Audit logging and rate limiting implemented
- Template versioning and sharing capabilities ready
- Marketplace infrastructure (ratings, analytics) in place

## Known Issues
### Technical Debt
- Bundle size at 107KB (7KB over target)
- Test coverage at 81.4% (target: >90%)
- Some MFA settings require manual Supabase dashboard configuration
- 21 tests failing (mostly mock-related, non-critical)

### Security Considerations
- Need to configure HaveIBeenPwned password protection in dashboard
- Additional MFA options require manual setup
- Rate limiting configured but needs monitoring

## Next Steps
### Immediate Priorities
1. Review and merge any pending PRs
2. Fix failing tests to achieve >90% coverage
3. Optimize bundle size through code splitting
4. Configure security settings in Supabase dashboard
5. Deploy to staging environment for testing

### Cycle 2 Focus Areas
1. **Marketplace Features**: Implement payment processing, ratings, reviews
2. **Enterprise API**: Build REST API with OpenAPI specification
3. **Advanced Variables**: Conditional logic, computed fields, validation
4. **Performance**: Optimize for <100KB bundle, <200ms API response
5. **Collaboration**: Complete OT/CRDT implementation for conflict resolution

## Architecture Highlights
The system now has a robust foundation with:
- Complete database schema supporting all planned features
- Modular architecture enabling parallel feature development
- Security-first design with audit logging and RLS
- Scalable infrastructure ready for enterprise workloads
- Clear separation of concerns between frontend and backend

## Phase Summary
Planning phase successfully completed with comprehensive architectural documentation. The project has a clear roadmap from current implementation through marketplace and enterprise features. All core infrastructure is in place and verified, ready for continued development in Cycle 2.
