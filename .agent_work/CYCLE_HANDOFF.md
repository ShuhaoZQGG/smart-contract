- Branch: cycle-1-featuresstatus-allcomplete-20250902-132535
- Phase: planning (complete)

## Completed Work
<!-- Updated by each agent as they complete their phase -->

### Planning Phase (Complete)
- ✅ Analyzed project vision and existing documentation
- ✅ Reviewed README.md with comprehensive feature list
- ✅ Reviewed DESIGN.md for UI/UX specifications
- ✅ Reviewed IMPLEMENTATION.md showing Cycle 1 features complete
- ✅ Reviewed REVIEW.md confirming PR #10 ready to merge
- ✅ Created comprehensive PLAN.md with architectural decisions

## Pending Items
<!-- Items that need attention in the next phase or cycle -->

### For Design Phase
- Real-time collaboration UI design needed
- Template marketplace interface design
- Analytics dashboard wireframes
- Team workspace concepts

### For Implementation
- Code splitting for bundle optimization (currently 546KB)
- Fix 3 skipped tests with mock limitations
- Optimize unused database indexes

## Technical Decisions
<!-- Important technical decisions made during this cycle -->

### Architecture Decisions
- **Tech Stack**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Supabase
- **Document Processing**: mammoth, pdf-lib, docxtemplater
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with RLS policies
- **Deployment**: Vercel/Netlify + Supabase Cloud
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library

### Key Design Patterns
- Single Page Application (SPA)
- Row Level Security for multi-tenancy
- Optimistic UI updates
- Edge Functions for document processing

## Known Issues
<!-- Issues discovered but not yet resolved -->

### Non-Critical
- Bundle size: 546KB (optimization needed)
- 3 skipped tests due to mock limitations
- Unused database indexes (performance opportunity)

### Resolved in Cycle 1
- All lint warnings fixed ✅
- Build successful with no warnings ✅
- 49 tests passing ✅

## Next Steps
<!-- Clear action items for the next agent/cycle -->

### Immediate Actions
1. Merge PR #10 to main branch (approved and ready)
2. Start Cycle 2 planning for collaboration features
3. Implement code splitting for performance
4. Design template marketplace UI
5. Enhance test coverage for skipped tests

### Cycle 2 Focus Areas
- Real-time collaborative editing
- Template versioning UI
- Template marketplace
- Performance optimizations
- Enhanced error handling
