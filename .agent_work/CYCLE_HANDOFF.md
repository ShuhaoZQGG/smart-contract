Generated: Tue  2 Sep 2025 21:56:25 EDT

## Current State
- Cycle Number: 1
- Branch: cycle-1-3-verified-20250902-215627
- Phase: design (completed)

## Completed Work
### Planning Phase (Completed)
- **Design**: Created UI/UX specifications and mockups
- **Planning**: Created architectural plan and requirements
- Created comprehensive PLAN.md with full project architecture
- Analyzed existing README.md, DESIGN.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md, and REVIEW.md
- Identified that Cycle 1 core features are already complete (PR #17 merged)
- Defined clear roadmap for Cycles 2-3
- Established technology stack and Supabase integration strategy

### Design Phase (Completed)
- **UI/UX Design**: Created comprehensive design specifications in DESIGN.md
- Defined brand identity and visual design system
- Created detailed page layouts for all core features:
  - Dashboard with template management
  - Lexical rich text editor with variable system
  - Document generation forms
  - Bulk generation interface
  - Template library/marketplace preview
- Established mobile responsive design patterns
- Specified accessibility requirements (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Designed Supabase Auth integration flows
- Queried and incorporated actual database schema from Supabase

## Pending Items
- Implementation phase should address:
  - Set up Shadcn/ui component library
  - Implement Lexical editor with variable insertion
  - Build responsive layout components
  - Create form generation system
  - Integrate Supabase Auth UI
- Consider fixing RLS performance warnings identified in planning
- Add E2E tests for critical user flows

## Technical Decisions
### Architecture Choices
- Confirmed React 18.3 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS frontend
- Supabase for all backend services (DB, Auth, Storage, Functions)
- Lexical editor for rich text (already integrated)
- Document processing: mammoth (DOCX), pdf-lib (PDF), docxtemplater

### Design Decisions
- Primary color: #3B82F6 (Blue-500)
- Component library: Shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS
- Icon library: Lucide React
- Animation: Framer Motion
- Form handling: React Hook Form + Zod

### Database Design
- 7 core tables confirmed via Supabase query:
  - profiles, templates, template_versions
  - variables, generated_documents
  - template_shares, bulk_generations
- All tables have RLS enabled
- Foreign key relationships properly configured

### Performance Strategy
- Code splitting for editor and document libraries
- Progressive image loading
- LocalStorage for template caching
- IndexedDB for large documents
- Service worker for offline support

## Frontend Framework Recommendations
- **React 18.3** with TypeScript 5.6
- **Vite** for build tooling
- **TanStack Query** for data fetching
- **Zustand** for global state management
- **Framer Motion** for animations
- Maintain existing auto-save at 30-second intervals

## Design Constraints for Development
- Initial load: <2s
- Time to interactive: <3s
- Maximum bundle size: 200KB (gzipped)
- Browser support: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
- Maximum template size: 10MB
- Maximum variables per template: 100
- Maximum bulk generation: 1000 documents

## Known Issues
- 13 unused database indexes (INFO level - expected)
- Some unused imports causing build warnings
- RLS performance warnings need addressing
- Missing E2E tests for critical flows

## Next Steps
### For Implementation Phase
1. Set up Shadcn/ui component library
2. Implement Lexical editor with variable system
3. Create responsive layout components
4. Build form generation system
5. Integrate Supabase Auth UI
6. Fix RLS performance issues (critical)
7. Add comprehensive test coverage
