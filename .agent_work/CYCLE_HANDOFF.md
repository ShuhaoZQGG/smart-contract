## Current State
- Cycle Number: 1 (Continuation)
- Branch: cycle-1-i-have-20250903-101358
- Phase: planning (COMPLETE)
- PR: #36 (Active)

## Completed Work
### Planning Phase âœ…
- Analyzed existing implementation from PR #31 (merged)
- Identified 3 critical features for Cycle 1 continuation:
  1. Advanced Variable System
  2. Conflict Resolution (Yjs CRDT)
  3. Comment System
- Updated PLAN.md with architectural decisions
- Defined implementation strategy (7-day timeline)

## Pending Items
### For Design Phase
- Create UI/UX specifications for:
  1. Advanced variable configuration interface
  2. Conflict resolution UI
  3. Comment thread interface
- Update component hierarchy
- Define user flows for new features

## Technical Decisions
1. **Variable Enhancement**: AST-based evaluation for complex logic
2. **Collaboration**: Yjs CRDT with Supabase Realtime transport
3. **Database**: Extend existing schema (no breaking changes)
4. **Dependencies**: Add yjs, y-lexical for CRDT support

## Known Issues
- 3 tests failing (from previous cycle)
- Bundle size at 107KB (7KB over target)
- Manual Supabase configuration needed for security

## Next Steps
### Design Phase Requirements
1. Read updated PLAN.md for architectural context
2. Design advanced variable UI (dropdowns, formulas, validation)
3. Create conflict resolution merge interface
4. Design inline comment system
5. Ensure mobile responsiveness
6. Update DESIGN.md with specifications
