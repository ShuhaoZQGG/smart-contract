## Current State
- Cycle Number: 1 (Continuation - Cycle 2 Architecture Planning)
- Branch: cycle-1-all-core-20250904-014216
- Phase: design (UI/UX specifications complete)

## Completed Work
<!-- Updated by each agent as they complete their phase -->
- **Design**: Created UI/UX specifications and mockups
- **Planning**: Created architectural plan and requirements
- **Design**: UI/UX specifications with complete mockups and responsive design

### Planning Phase (Cycle 2 Architecture) - COMPLETE
- ✅ Analyzed current infrastructure status via Supabase MCP
- ✅ Verified all 16 database tables operational with RLS
- ✅ Confirmed 5 Edge Functions deployed and active
- ✅ Created comprehensive Cycle 2 architectural plan
- ✅ Defined 4-week implementation roadmap
- ✅ Specified monetization strategy with Stripe integration
- ✅ Designed enterprise feature architecture
- ✅ Planned advanced variable system enhancements

### Design Phase - COMPLETE
- ✅ Created comprehensive UI/UX specifications in DESIGN.md
- ✅ Designed all core feature interfaces (upload, editor, generation, marketplace)
- ✅ Aligned UI components with all 16 Supabase database tables
- ✅ Specified mobile-responsive layouts (320px to 1440px+)
- ✅ Included real-time collaboration UI with presence indicators
- ✅ Designed Supabase Auth integration flows
- ✅ Created accessibility specifications (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- ✅ Provided complete component library and design tokens

### Key Architectural Decisions Made
1. **Performance Optimization**: Bundle size reduction strategy (<100KB)
2. **Monetization**: 70/30 revenue split, Stripe payment processing
3. **Enterprise Features**: API tiers, webhook system, team management
4. **Advanced Variables**: Conditional, computed, and external data sources
5. **Scalability**: Multi-layer caching, CDN, database optimization

### Key Design Decisions Made
1. **Design System**: Indigo/Emerald color scheme with Inter font
2. **Editor**: Lexical rich text with inline variable insertion
3. **Collaboration**: Real-time cursors with Yjs CRDT sync
4. **Mobile**: Touch-optimized with bottom sheets and swipe gestures
5. **Framework**: React 19 with Next.js 14, TailwindCSS, Radix UI

## Pending Items
<!-- Items that need attention in the next phase or cycle -->

### Immediate Actions Required
1. Configure Supabase security settings via dashboard (manual)
2. Fix 18 test mock failures for Supabase methods
3. Optimize bundle size from 107KB to <100KB
4. Merge PR #48 and resolve conflicts

### Week 1 Priorities
- Bundle optimization and code splitting
- Test infrastructure improvements
- Security configuration in Supabase dashboard
- Performance metrics setup

## Technical Decisions
<!-- Important technical decisions made during this cycle -->

### Database Schema Extensions
- `template_pricing` table for monetization
- `transactions` table for payment tracking
- `revenue_shares` table for creator payouts
- `teams` and `team_members` tables for collaboration
- `team_templates` table for shared access control

### New Edge Functions Planned
- `payment-processor` for Stripe integration
- `webhook-delivery` for reliable webhook dispatch
- `api-gateway` for rate-limited API access

### Technology Stack Additions
- **Payments**: Stripe Checkout, Payment Intents
- **Monitoring**: Sentry, Mixpanel, Datadog
- **Caching**: Cloudflare Edge, Redis
- **CDN**: Cloudflare for document delivery

## Known Issues
<!-- Issues discovered but not yet resolved -->

1. **Bundle Size**: Currently 107KB (7KB over target)
2. **Test Failures**: 18 mock-related failures (non-critical)
3. **Security Config**: Requires manual dashboard configuration
4. **PR Conflicts**: PR #48 needs conflict resolution

## Next Steps
<!-- Clear action items for the next agent/cycle -->

### For Implementation Phase Agent
1. Begin bundle optimization work immediately
2. Implement Stripe integration Edge Function
3. Create team management database migrations
4. Build advanced variable system
5. Deploy payment processing infrastructure

### For Review Phase Agent
1. Verify all Cycle 2 requirements met
2. Test payment flows end-to-end
3. Validate enterprise features
4. Performance test at scale
5. Security audit new features

## Success Criteria for Cycle 2
- Bundle size <100KB
- 100% test pass rate
- Payment processing functional
- 5 new Edge Functions deployed
- 6 new database tables created
- API gateway operational
- Webhook system reliable
- Team features complete

## Infrastructure Status Summary
```
Database Tables: 16/16 operational ✅
Edge Functions: 5/5 active ✅
Authentication: Configured ✅
Storage: Operational ✅
Realtime: WebSocket active ✅
Tests: 92/113 passing (81.4%)
Bundle: 107KB (target <100KB)
```

## Risk Mitigation Notes
- Supabase rate limits: Implement caching layer
- Payment compliance: Legal review required
- Bundle size: Aggressive code splitting needed
- Test coverage: Focus on mock improvements

## Design Constraints for Development
- **Bundle Size**: Keep under 100KB with code splitting
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44x44px for mobile
- **Load Time**: LCP under 2.5s, FID under 100ms
- **Accessibility**: Maintain WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **State Management**: Use Zustand for global, React Query for server state

## Frontend Framework Recommendations
- **React 19.0.1** with TypeScript 5.3.3
- **Next.js 14** for SSR/SSG capabilities
- **TailwindCSS** for utility-first styling
- **Lexical** for rich text editing
- **Radix UI** for accessible primitives
- **Framer Motion** for animations
- **React Hook Form** with Zod validation
- **Supabase JS Client** for backend integration

## Handoff Complete
Design phase successfully completed. Comprehensive UI/UX specifications delivered in DESIGN.md with:
- Complete mockups for all core features
- Mobile-responsive designs (320px-1440px+)
- Accessibility specifications (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Real-time collaboration UI patterns
- Component library and design tokens
- Direct alignment with all 16 Supabase tables
- Supabase Auth integration flows

Ready for implementation phase to build the UI according to specifications.
