## Current State
- Cycle Number: 1
- Branch: cycle-1-cycle-1-20250902-134531
- Phase: design (complete)

## Completed Work
### Planning Phase
- **Design**: Created UI/UX specifications and mockups
- **Planning**: Created architectural plan and requirements
- ✅ Analyzed project vision and existing README.md requirements
- ✅ Reviewed previous cycle implementation (49 tests passing, build successful)
- ✅ Updated comprehensive PLAN.md with aligned architecture
- ✅ Verified Supabase integration (5 tables, 4 Edge Functions deployed)
- ✅ Identified completed features and future enhancements

### Design Phase
- **Completed**: Comprehensive UI/UX design specifications
- ✅ Designed user journeys for all core features from README.md
- ✅ Created mockups for Template Editor with {{variable}} insertion
- ✅ Designed responsive layouts (desktop to mobile)
- ✅ Specified Supabase Auth UI integration
- ✅ Added accessibility features (WCAG 2.1 AA compliant)
- ✅ Designed analytics dashboard and real-time collaboration features
- ✅ Created bulk generation workflow with CSV mapping
- ✅ Added performance optimization strategies

## Pending Items
### For Implementation Phase
- Bundle size optimization (current: 546KB)
- Fix 3 skipped tests (mock limitations)
- Performance improvements for bulk generation
- Implement lazy loading for template lists
- Add skeleton loaders for better UX
- Integrate Lexical/Slate.js for rich text editing

## Technical Decisions
### Major Architecture Choices
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions)
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **Document Processing**: mammoth, pdf-lib, docxtemplater
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library
- **Security**: Row Level Security policies on all tables

### Database Design
- 5 core tables: templates, template_versions, generated_documents, profiles, variables
- JSONB for flexible content storage
- UUID primary keys for security
- Comprehensive RLS policies

### Design Decisions
- **UI Framework**: Shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS for consistent components
- **Editor**: Lexical/Slate.js for rich text with variable highlighting
- **State Management**: Zustand or Context API for simplicity
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod for validation
- **Charts**: Recharts for analytics visualizations
- **Icons**: Lucide React for consistent iconography
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth transitions

## Known Issues
- Bundle size needs optimization (546KB)
- 3 tests skipped due to mock limitations
- Some database indexes may be unused
- Code splitting opportunities identified

## Next Steps
### Immediate Actions for Implementation Phase
1. Implement the designed Template Editor with variable insertion
2. Build document generation form with validation
3. Create bulk CSV upload and mapping interface
4. Integrate Supabase Auth UI components
5. Optimize bundle size with code splitting
6. Add skeleton loaders and loading states
7. Implement auto-save in editor
8. Set up real-time collaboration foundations
