## Pending Items
<!-- Items that need attention in the next phase or cycle -->

### PR Status
- **PR #49**: Updated with resolved conflicts (ready for review/merge)
- **Other open PRs**: #45, #46, #48 still pending

### Security Configuration (Manual)
- Enable leaked password protection in Supabase dashboard
- Configure additional MFA options
- Both require manual dashboard access

## Technical Decisions
<!-- Important technical decisions made during this cycle -->
### Review Findings
- All infrastructure verified operational via Supabase MCP
- Core features implementation complete
- PR cannot be merged due to conflicts
- No architecture or design changes needed

### Architecture Choices
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Realtime, Edge Functions)
- **Frontend**: React 19.0.1 with TypeScript 5.3.3
- **Editor**: Lexical for rich text editing with variable support
- **Document Processing**: mammoth (DOCX), pdf-lib (PDF), docxtemplater
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with Material Design 3 components
- **Testing**: Jest with React Testing Library
- **Deployment**: Vercel/Netlify (frontend), Supabase (backend)

### Frontend Framework Recommendations
- **Component Library**: MUI (Material-UI) v5 for Material Design 3
- **State Management**: Zustand for global state, React Query for server state
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Animation**: Framer Motion for smooth transitions
- **Virtual Lists**: react-window for performance
- **File Upload**: react-dropzone
- **Rich Text**: Lexical with custom variable plugin

### Database Design
- 16 tables covering all features from templates to analytics
- Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
- Audit logging for compliance
- Rate limiting for API protection

## Known Issues
<!-- Issues discovered but not yet resolved -->

### From Previous Cycles
- 18 test failures (mock-related, non-critical)
- Bundle size 7KB over target (107KB vs 100KB)
- Manual Supabase dashboard configuration required for some security features

### Current Considerations
- GitHub repository may not exist yet (need to create/connect)
- Need to verify Supabase project connection
- Edge Functions need deployment after database setup

## Next Steps
<!-- Clear action items for the next agent/cycle -->

### Immediate Actions
1. Merge PR #49 to main branch
2. Close other stale PRs (#45, #46, #48)
3. Configure manual Supabase security settings
4. Begin Cycle 2 enhancements

### Cycle 2 Priorities
1. Optimize bundle size below 100KB
2. Fix remaining 18 test failures
3. Implement marketplace monetization
4. Add enterprise API features
5. Enhanced collaboration tools
