## Current State
- Cycle Number: 1
- Branch: cycle-1-✅-verified-20250903-032701
- Phase: review

## Completed Work
<!-- Updated by each agent as they complete their phase -->
- **Planning**: Created architectural plan and requirements
### Planning Phase ✅
- Analyzed project vision and requirements from README.md
- Reviewed previous work (DESIGN.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md, REVIEW.md from PR #31)
- Created comprehensive architectural plan in PLAN.md
- Established technology stack decisions
- Defined implementation phases and timeline
- Documented risk assessment and mitigation strategies

### Design Phase ✅
- Created comprehensive UI/UX specifications in DESIGN.md
- Designed information architecture with clear navigation structure
- Created detailed page layouts for Dashboard, Template Editor, Document Generation, and Marketplace
- Specified responsive design breakpoints and mobile interfaces
- Defined accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
- Documented real-time collaboration UI components
- Established design system with colors, typography, and component states
- Integrated Supabase Auth UI components into design
- Aligned UI with all 16 Supabase database tables

## Pending Items
<!-- Items that need attention in the next phase or cycle -->
- Development phase needs to implement UI components based on design specs
- Supabase security configuration needs manual dashboard setup

## Technical Decisions
<!-- Important technical decisions made during this cycle -->
### Architecture Stack Confirmed
- **Frontend**: React 18.2 + TypeScript 5.3, Lexical Editor for rich text
- **State Management**: Zustand (client), React Query (server)
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Edge Functions, Auth, Storage, Realtime)
- **Document Processing**: mammoth (DOCX), pdf-lib (PDF), docxtemplater (templates)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components + Supabase Auth UI
- **Deployment**: Vercel with blue-green strategy

### Key Architectural Patterns
- Row-level security on all database tables
- WebSocket-based real-time collaboration
- Edge Functions for document processing
- Component-based frontend architecture
- Test-driven development approach

### Design System Decisions
- **Color Palette**: Blue-500 primary, Purple-500 secondary for variable highlighting
- **Component Library**: shadcn/ui + Supabase Auth UI for consistency
- **Icons**: Lucide Icons for universal icon set
- **Tables**: @tanstack/react-table for advanced data grids
- **Charts**: Recharts for analytics visualizations
- **Mobile-First**: Responsive breakpoints at 320px, 768px, 1024px

## Known Issues
<!-- Issues discovered but not yet resolved -->
- HaveIBeenPwned password protection needs manual enabling
- Limited MFA options currently configured
- Bundle size at 107KB (slightly above 100KB target)
- 3 tests currently skipped (auth-related)

## Next Steps
<!-- Clear action items for the next agent/cycle -->
1. **Development Phase**: 
   - Implement UI components based on DESIGN.md specifications
   - Integrate with existing Supabase backend (16 tables, 4 Edge Functions)
   - Ensure real-time collaboration features work with UI
   - Fix remaining 3 test failures
2. **Review Phase**: 
   - Validate all core features work end-to-end
   - Ensure UI matches design specifications
   - Test responsive design across devices
3. **Post-Merge**: 
   - Configure security settings in Supabase Dashboard
   - Enable HaveIBeenPwned and MFA options
