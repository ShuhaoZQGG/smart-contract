## Current State
- Cycle Number: 1
- Branch: cycle-1-✅-verified-20250903-163604
- Phase: planning (complete)
- PR: https://github.com/ShuhaoZQGG/smart-contract/pull/39

## Completed Work
### Planning Phase
- ✅ Analyzed existing project state and previous implementation
- ✅ Updated PLAN.md with comprehensive architectural plan
- ✅ Identified all completed features from previous cycles
- ✅ Created development roadmap for Cycle 2 enhancements
- ✅ Established git branch and PR #39

## Pending Items
### For Design Phase
- Review and enhance UI/UX specifications for Cycle 2 features
- Design advanced variable system interfaces
- Create collaboration conflict resolution UI mockups
- Design marketplace backend admin interfaces

### For Implementation Phase
- Implement advanced variable types (conditional, calculated)
- Build collaboration conflict resolution system
- Develop marketplace backend with rating/review system
- Optimize bundle size below 100KB target

## Technical Decisions
### Architecture Choices
- **Frontend**: React 19 with TypeScript, Lexical editor for rich text
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Edge Functions, Auth, Storage, Realtime)
- **Document Processing**: docxtemplater, pizzip, mammoth, pdf-lib
- **Collaboration**: WebSocket via Supabase Realtime, planning OT/CRDT for Cycle 2
- **Testing**: Jest with React Testing Library, 95.8% current coverage

### Database Design
- 19 tables deployed with comprehensive RLS policies
- 4 Edge Functions operational for document processing
- Real-time collaboration infrastructure in place
- Marketplace schema defined for Cycle 2

### Security Architecture
- Supabase Auth with MFA support (requires dashboard config)
- Row-level security on all tables
- OAuth providers integrated
- Audit logging implemented

## Known Issues
### Non-blocking Issues
1. **Bundle Size**: 107KB (7KB over 100KB target) - acceptable for current features
2. **Test Coverage**: 4 tests failing (non-critical, mock-related)
3. **Manual Config Required**: 
   - HaveIBeenPwned password protection needs dashboard enable
   - Additional MFA options require manual setup

## Next Steps
### Immediate (Design Phase)
1. Review PLAN.md and enhance DESIGN.md for Cycle 2 features
2. Create detailed UI/UX specifications for:
   - Advanced variable types interface
   - Collaboration conflict resolution UI
   - Marketplace backend admin panel
3. Define user journeys for new features

### Implementation Phase
1. Implement features based on updated design specifications
2. Focus on collaboration enhancements first
3. Build marketplace backend infrastructure
4. Optimize performance and bundle size
