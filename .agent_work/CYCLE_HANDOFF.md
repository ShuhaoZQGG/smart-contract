## Current State
- Cycle Number: 1
- Branch: cycle-1-1-merged-20250903-223854
- Phase: review

## Completed Work
<!-- Updated by each agent as they complete their phase -->
- **Planning**: Created architectural plan and requirements
- **Planning Phase**: Comprehensive architectural plan created
- **Requirements Analysis**: Vision aligned with README.md core features
- **Tech Stack Confirmation**: React/TypeScript + Supabase infrastructure
- **Risk Assessment**: Identified and documented mitigation strategies
- **Performance Targets**: Set clear metrics for Cycle 2
- **Design Phase**: Comprehensive UI/UX specifications created in DESIGN.md
  - Material UI v5 design system foundation
  - Complete user journeys mapped
  - All core features have UI mockups
  - Mobile responsive designs included
  - Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
  - Supabase Auth UI integration patterns

## Pending Items
<!-- Items that need attention in the next phase or cycle -->
- PR #43 needs to be merged (contains test improvements only)
- Manual Supabase dashboard configuration for security features
- Bundle size optimization (currently 107KB, target <100KB)
- 21 test failures need fixing for full test suite stability

## Technical Decisions
<!-- Important technical decisions made during this cycle -->
- **Supabase-first Architecture**: Leveraging managed services for rapid development
- **Yjs CRDT**: Chosen for conflict-free real-time collaboration
- **Lexical Editor**: Selected for rich text editing capabilities
- **Material UI v5**: Design system for consistent UI/UX
- **Edge Functions**: Using Deno runtime for serverless processing

## Known Issues
<!-- Issues discovered but not yet resolved -->
- Test suite: 21 tests failing (mock-related, non-critical)
- Bundle size: 7KB over 100KB target
- Security advisors require manual dashboard configuration:
  - Leaked password protection
  - Additional MFA options

## Next Steps
<!-- Clear action items for the next agent/cycle -->
1. Development phase should implement UI components based on DESIGN.md
2. Focus on implementing Cycle 2 priority features:
   - Advanced variables system UI
   - Enhanced collaboration interface
   - Marketplace backend integration
3. Ensure all designs are properly connected to Supabase backend
4. Implement performance optimizations outlined in design specs
