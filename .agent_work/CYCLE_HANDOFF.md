## Current State
- Cycle Number: 1
- Branch: cycle-1-all-core-20250904-021712
- Phase: development (attempt 1 complete)

## Completed Work
<!-- Updated by each agent as they complete their phase -->
- **Planning**: Created architectural plan and requirements
- **Design**: UI/UX specifications with Material Design 3, responsive layouts, accessibility
- **Development (Attempt 1)**: 
  - Fixed critical test suite errors in 3 component test files
  - Improved test pass rate to 84.1% (95/113 tests passing)
  - Verified production build successful (main bundle: 360KB)
  - Resolved Supabase mock initialization issues

<!-- HANDOFF_START -->
### Development Tasks Completed (Attempt 1)
- **Test Suite Fixes**: Resolved initialization errors in ConflictResolution, TemplateComments, and AdvancedVariables tests
- **Mock Improvements**: Fixed jest.mock hoisting issues for Supabase client
- **Build Verification**: Production build successful with all chunks generated
- **Infrastructure Status**: Confirmed all 16 tables and 5 Edge Functions operational
<!-- HANDOFF_END -->

## Pending Items
<!-- Items that need attention in the next phase or cycle -->
- Remaining test failures: 18 tests still failing (mostly UI interaction tests)
- Bundle size optimization: Currently at 360KB (target <100KB) 
- Some complex test scenarios need better mock implementations

## Technical Decisions
<!-- Important technical decisions made during this cycle -->
- Material Design 3 for consistency and modern UX
- Supabase Auth UI components for authentication flows
- Lexical editor for rich text with variable support
- WebSocket via Supabase Realtime for collaboration
- Jest mock hoisting pattern for Supabase client tests

## Known Issues
<!-- Issues discovered but not yet resolved -->
- Bundle size at 360KB (significantly over 100KB target)
- 18 test failures remaining (UI interaction and async timing issues)
- Some test warnings about async operations

## Next Steps
<!-- Clear action items for the next agent/cycle -->
- Continue fixing remaining test failures
- Implement aggressive bundle optimization (code splitting, lazy loading)
- Consider removing large dependencies or finding lighter alternatives
- Complete remaining core feature implementations if any
