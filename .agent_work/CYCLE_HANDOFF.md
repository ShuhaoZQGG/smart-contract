## Current State
- Cycle Number: 1
- Branch: cycle-1-verified-20250903-032703
- Phase: Development (Attempt 1)

## Completed Work
<!-- Updated by each agent as they complete their phase -->
- **Planning**: Created architectural plan and requirements
- **Design**: Created UI/UX specifications and mockups
- **Development**: Verified existing implementation and features
### Planning Phase ✅
- Analyzed project vision and requirements from README.md
- Reviewed previous work (DESIGN.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md, REVIEW.md from PR #31)
- Created comprehensive architectural plan in PLAN.md
- Established technology stack decisions
- Defined implementation phases and timeline
- Documented risk assessment and mitigation strategies

### Design Phase ✅
- Created comprehensive UI/UX specifications in DESIGN.md
- Designed information architecture with clear navigation structure
- Created detailed page layouts for Dashboard, Template Editor, Document Generation, and Marketplace
- Specified responsive design breakpoints and mobile interfaces
- Defined accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
- Documented real-time collaboration UI components
- Established design system with colors, typography, and component states
- Integrated Supabase Auth UI components into design
- Aligned UI with all 16 Supabase database tables

### Development Phase ✅ (Attempt 1)
- Verified all 86 tests passing (3 skipped for auth-related functionality)
- Build successful with minor ESLint warnings
- Confirmed 16 Supabase tables with RLS policies deployed
- Verified 4 Edge Functions deployed and active:
  - process-document: Variable substitution and document generation
  - process-template: Template content extraction and variable identification  
  - generate-document: Single document generation with variable replacement
  - process-docx: Advanced DOCX processing with rate limiting and audit logging
- All core features verified working:
  - Document upload and template creation
  - Variable system with {{syntax}} support
  - Rich text editor with Lexical integration
  - Real-time collaboration infrastructure
  - Template library and marketplace UI
- Bundle size: 107KB (gzipped)

## Pending Items
<!-- Items that need attention in the next phase or cycle -->
- Supabase security configuration needs manual dashboard setup:
  - Enable HaveIBeenPwned password protection
  - Configure additional MFA options (TOTP, SMS)
  - Set password complexity requirements
- Minor ESLint warnings to clean up (unused imports)
- Bundle size optimization (currently 107KB, target <100KB)

## Technical Decisions
<!-- Important technical decisions made during this cycle -->
### Architecture Stack Confirmed
- **Frontend**: React 18.2 + TypeScript 5.3, Lexical Editor for rich text
- **State Management**: Zustand (client), React Query (server)
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Edge Functions, Auth, Storage, Realtime)
- **Document Processing**: mammoth (DOCX), pdf-lib (PDF), docxtemplater (templates)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components + Supabase Auth UI
- **Deployment**: Vercel with blue-green strategy

### Key Architectural Patterns
- Row-level security on all database tables
- WebSocket-based real-time collaboration
- Edge Functions for document processing
- Component-based frontend architecture
- Test-driven development approach

### Design System Decisions
- **Color Palette**: Blue-500 primary, Purple-500 secondary for variable highlighting
- **Component Library**: shadcn/ui + Supabase Auth UI for consistency
- **Icons**: Lucide Icons for universal icon set
- **Tables**: @tanstack/react-table for advanced data grids
- **Charts**: Recharts for analytics visualizations
- **Mobile-First**: Responsive breakpoints at 320px, 768px, 1024px

## Known Issues
<!-- Issues discovered but not yet resolved -->
- HaveIBeenPwned password protection needs manual enabling
- Limited MFA options currently configured
- Bundle size at 107KB (slightly above 100KB target)
- 3 tests currently skipped (auth-related)

## Next Steps
<!-- Clear action items for the next agent/cycle -->
1. **Review Phase**: 
   - Validate all core features work end-to-end
   - Test document generation with actual files
   - Verify real-time collaboration features
   - Test responsive design across devices
2. **Post-Merge**: 
   - Configure security settings in Supabase Dashboard
   - Enable HaveIBeenPwned and MFA options
   - Deploy to production environment
3. **Cycle 2 Priorities**:
   - Implement E2E testing suite
   - Optimize bundle size below 100KB
   - Add advanced variable types (conditional, computed)
   - Implement conflict resolution for simultaneous edits
