## Pending Items
<!-- Items that need attention in the next phase or cycle -->
### For Development Phase  
- Implement any missing UI components from DESIGN.md
- Bundle optimization (currently 107KB, target <100KB)
- Fix remaining 17 UI test failures
- Manual Supabase security configuration needed
- Ensure Lexical editor integration for rich text
- Implement Supabase Auth UI components

### For Cycle 2 Considerations
- Payment processing UI (Stripe integration)
- Advanced variable types UI (conditional, computed)
- Enterprise dashboard features
- Enhanced marketplace search/filtering

## Technical Decisions
<!-- Important technical decisions made during this cycle -->
### Architecture Choices
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Edge Functions, Auth, Storage)
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Lexical Editor
- **Document Processing**: mammoth, pdf-lib, docxtemplater
- **Real-time**: Supabase Realtime channels with Yjs CRDT
- **Testing**: Vitest with 84.1% coverage achieved

### Design Decisions
- **Design System**: Material Design 3 with custom extensions
- **Color Scheme**: Professional blue/green with amber for variables
- **Typography**: Inter for UI, JetBrains Mono for code/variables
- **Component Library**: React Material UI components
- **Animation**: Framer Motion for microinteractions
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Editor**: Lexical for rich text with variable highlighting

### Infrastructure Verified
- Database schema with 16 tables + RLS policies
- 5 Edge Functions handling core operations
- Authentication system with Supabase Auth
- Cloud storage buckets operational
- Rate limiting implemented in Edge Functions

## Known Issues
<!-- Issues discovered but not yet resolved -->
### Non-Critical Issues
- Bundle size 7KB over 100KB target (107KB current)
- 17 UI test failures related to mocks
- Manual security configuration required in Supabase Dashboard:
  - HaveIBeenPwned password protection
  - Additional MFA options

## Next Steps
<!-- Clear action items for the next agent/cycle -->
### Immediate Actions for Design Phase
1. Review and validate existing DESIGN.md specifications
2. Ensure UI/UX aligns with deployed infrastructure
3. Plan for Cycle 2 marketplace enhancements
4. Consider enterprise features in design updates

### Development Priorities (After Design)
1. Optimize bundle size below 100KB
2. Fix remaining test failures
3. Complete security configuration
4. Prepare for Cycle 2 features:
   - Marketplace monetization
   - Enterprise API
   - Advanced variable types
