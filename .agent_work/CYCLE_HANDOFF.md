Generated: Thu  4 Sep 2025 00:29:23 EDT

## Current State
- Cycle Number: 1
- Branch: cycle-1-✅-core-20250904-002925
- Phase: planning (complete) → design (next)

## Completed Work
<!-- Updated by each agent as they complete their phase -->

### Planning Phase ✅
- Created comprehensive PLAN.md with full architectural specifications
- Analyzed existing project state from previous cycles
- Defined 16 database tables with RLS policies for Supabase
- Specified 5 Edge Functions for document processing
- Established technology stack: React 19/TypeScript/Supabase/Lexical
- Created three-phase development roadmap
- Set performance targets and success metrics
- Documented API specifications and security measures

## Pending Items
<!-- Items that need attention in the next phase or cycle -->

### For Design Phase
- Review existing DESIGN.md file for UI/UX specifications
- Ensure alignment between planned features and design
- Consider any design updates needed for Cycle 2 features
- Validate mobile responsiveness requirements

### For Implementation
- Deploy Supabase infrastructure (tables, Edge Functions)
- Implement core document processing components
- Set up real-time collaboration with Supabase Realtime
- Configure authentication and security

## Technical Decisions
<!-- Important technical decisions made during this cycle -->

### Architecture Choices
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Realtime, Edge Functions)
- **Frontend**: React 19.0.1 with TypeScript 5.3.3
- **Editor**: Lexical for rich text editing with variable support
- **Document Processing**: mammoth (DOCX), pdf-lib (PDF), docxtemplater
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with Material Design 3 components
- **Testing**: Jest with React Testing Library
- **Deployment**: Vercel/Netlify (frontend), Supabase (backend)

### Database Design
- 16 tables covering all features from templates to analytics
- Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
- Audit logging for compliance
- Rate limiting for API protection

## Known Issues
<!-- Issues discovered but not yet resolved -->

### From Previous Cycles
- 18 test failures (mock-related, non-critical)
- Bundle size 7KB over target (107KB vs 100KB)
- Manual Supabase dashboard configuration required for some security features

### Current Considerations
- GitHub repository may not exist yet (need to create/connect)
- Need to verify Supabase project connection
- Edge Functions need deployment after database setup

## Next Steps
<!-- Clear action items for the next agent/cycle -->

### Immediate (Design Phase)
1. Review and validate existing DESIGN.md specifications
2. Ensure UI/UX aligns with PLAN.md architecture
3. Consider any design updates for Cycle 2 features
4. Document any design gaps or improvements needed

### Implementation Phase
1. Set up Supabase project if not exists
2. Create database migrations for all 16 tables
3. Deploy 5 Edge Functions
4. Implement core components:
   - FileUpload.tsx
   - TemplateEditor.tsx
   - VariableManager.tsx
   - DocumentGenerator.tsx
5. Configure authentication and RLS policies
6. Set up storage buckets for documents
