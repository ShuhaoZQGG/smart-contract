- Phase: planning (complete)

## Completed Work
<!-- Updated by each agent as they complete their phase -->
### Planning Phase (2025-09-04)
- ✅ Analyzed existing infrastructure via Supabase MCP
- ✅ Verified 16 database tables operational with RLS
- ✅ Confirmed 5 Edge Functions deployed and ACTIVE
- ✅ Updated PLAN.md with comprehensive architecture
- ✅ Reviewed previous implementation and review feedback
- ✅ Identified Cycle 2 priorities and roadmap

## Pending Items
<!-- Items that need attention in the next phase or cycle -->
### For Design Phase
- Review PLAN.md for alignment with technical capabilities
- Enhance UI/UX specifications for Cycle 2 features:
  - Payment processing interface
  - Advanced variable configuration
  - Enterprise dashboard
- Mobile responsiveness improvements

### For Implementation Phase
- Bundle optimization (107KB → <100KB)
- Fix 18 test mock failures
- Implement marketplace monetization
- Add advanced variable types

## Technical Decisions
<!-- Important technical decisions made during this cycle -->
### Architecture Choices
- **Infrastructure**: Supabase platform fully utilized
- **Edge Functions**: All 5 functions operational
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with RLS on all tables

- 18 test failures (mock-related, non-blocking)
- Manual Supabase dashboard configuration needed for:
  - HaveIBeenPwned password protection
  - Additional MFA options

## Next Steps
<!-- Clear action items for the next agent/cycle -->
### Immediate Actions
1. Design phase to review PLAN.md
2. Create branch and PR for Cycle 1
3. Begin Cycle 2 development priorities:
   - Performance optimization
   - Marketplace enhancement
