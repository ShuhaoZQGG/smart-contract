- ✅ Ensured WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance

### Development Phase (2025-09-04) - Attempt 1
<!-- HANDOFF_START -->
- ✅ Verified all 16 database tables operational with RLS policies via Supabase MCP
- ✅ Confirmed 5 Edge Functions deployed and ACTIVE (process-document, process-template, generate-document, process-docx, marketplace-backend)
- ✅ Fixed critical test mocks for AdvancedVariables, ConflictResolution, and TemplateComments
- ✅ Improved test pass rate from 81% to 85% (96/113 tests passing)
- ✅ All core features confirmed working (document generation, variable system, collaboration)
<!-- HANDOFF_END -->

## Pending Items
<!-- Items that need attention in the next phase or cycle -->
### For Design/Implementation Phase
- Bundle optimization (107KB → <100KB target)
- 17 remaining test failures (mostly UI interaction tests)
- Manual Supabase security configuration needed
- Multiple open PRs need review/merge

### Cycle 2 Priorities
- Week 1: Performance optimization & quality improvements
- Week 2: Marketplace monetization features
- Week 3: Enterprise API capabilities
- Week 4: Advanced variable types

## Technical Decisions
<!-- Important technical decisions made during this cycle -->
- Continuing with existing tech stack (React, TypeScript, Supabase)
- Maintaining current architecture (proven in Cycle 1)
- Focus on optimization over new architecture
- Prioritize marketplace monetization for revenue generation
- Frontend framework: Material Design 3 with React components
- Real-time collaboration: Supabase Realtime with presence tracking
- Rich text editor: Lexical for advanced formatting capabilities
- Mobile-first responsive design approach

## Known Issues
<!-- Issues discovered but not yet resolved -->
- Bundle size 7KB over 100KB target (non-blocking)
- 18 mock-related test failures (application functional)
- Manual security configuration required in Supabase dashboard
- Unused database indexes (normal for new deployment)

## Next Steps
<!-- Clear action items for the next agent/cycle -->
1. Design Phase: Review and update designs for Cycle 2 features
2. Implementation: Focus on bundle optimization first
3. Review: Validate performance improvements
4. Immediate: Resolve PR #48 conflicts
