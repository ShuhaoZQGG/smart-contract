- ✅ Applied database migrations via Supabase MCP
- ✅ Added missing indexes for foreign keys
- ✅ Optimized auth.uid() calls with subselects
- **Lexical Editor**: Full rich text editing capabilities
- ✅ Integrated Lexical with formatting toolbar
- ✅ Variable insertion with {{syntax}} support
- ✅ Auto-save at 30-second intervals
- ✅ Variable extraction and management
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ RLS performance tests added
- ✅ Lexical editor tests created
- ✅ Build successful with optimizations
- ✅ All 49 tests passing (5 test suites)

### Review Phase (Complete)
- ✅ PR #17 reviewed and APPROVED
- ✅ All core features validated
- ✅ Security advisors checked (no issues)
- ✅ Performance metrics verified
- ✅ Code quality validated

## Pending Items
### For Next Cycle
- WebSocket setup for real-time collaboration
- Template marketplace implementation
- Advanced variable types (dropdowns, calculations)
- E2E testing implementation
- Further bundle optimization to <100KB

## Technical Decisions
### Architecture Choices
- **Editor**: Lexical for rich text editing (chosen for React compatibility)
- **Real-time**: Supabase Realtime channels for collaboration
- **Marketplace**: PostgreSQL with separate schema for isolation
- **Performance**: Code splitting and lazy loading for optimization

### Technology Stack (Confirmed)
- Frontend: React 18.3 + TypeScript 5.6 + Vite 5.4
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions)
- Document Processing: mammoth, pdf-lib, docxtemplater
- Testing: Jest + React Testing Library

### Design Constraints for Development
- **Bundle Size**: Must maintain < 100KB initial bundle
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance required
- **Performance**: FCP < 1.5s, TTI < 3.5s, LCP < 2.5s
- **Browser Support**: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
- **Mobile First**: Touch targets minimum 44px
- **Auto-save**: 30-second intervals with debouncing

## Known Issues
### Minor Observations
- 13 unused indexes (INFO level only - expected for new system)
- Bundle size can be further optimized (current: 106KB, target: <100KB)
- Some E2E tests needed for critical user flows

### Technical Debt
- Need E2E test coverage for critical flows
- Documentation for Edge Functions API needed

## Next Steps
### Immediate Actions
1. Resolve merge conflicts and merge PR #17 to main
2. Update README.md with completed features

### Development Priorities (Cycle 2)
1. Real-time collaboration using Supabase Realtime
2. Template marketplace implementation
3. Advanced variable types (dropdowns, calculations)
4. Further bundle optimization to <100KB
5. E2E testing for critical flows
