- Phase: planning (completed)
- PR: https://github.com/ShuhaoZQGG/smart-contract/pull/6

## Completed Work
### Planning Phase ✅
- Analyzed existing project structure and documentation
- Created comprehensive PLAN.md with detailed requirements and architecture
- Established 5-phase implementation roadmap
- Defined success metrics and KPIs
- Created budget estimates and resource planning
- Set up git branch and created PR for Cycle 1

## Pending Items
### For Design Phase
- Create detailed UI mockups for template editor
- Design variable insertion toolbar and shortcuts
- Plan CSV upload and mapping interface
- Design analytics dashboard layout
- Consider real-time collaboration features

### Questions to Resolve
- Should we implement real-time collaboration in Phase 4 or defer to later?
- What level of template marketplace functionality for MVP?
- Priority between PDF vs DOCX generation quality?

## Technical Decisions
### Architecture Choices Made
1. **Frontend Stack**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Shadcn/ui
   - Rationale: Modern, performant, excellent DX, built-in accessibility
   
2. **Backend**: Supabase Platform
   - Rationale: Integrated auth/storage/realtime, cost-effective, scalable
   
3. **Document Processing**: Edge Functions with Deno
   - Rationale: Serverless, auto-scaling, close to data
   
4. **State Management**: Tanstack Query + Zustand
   - Rationale: Efficient caching, simple state management

### Database Design
- Schema already implemented and optimized
- RLS policies performance issues resolved
- Indexes optimized for query patterns

## Known Issues
### From Previous Implementation
- All critical issues resolved ✅
- 0 security warnings
- Only INFO level advisories remain

### Current Considerations
- Need to enhance template editor UI
- CSV processing interface needs implementation
- Analytics dashboard pending

## Next Steps
### Immediate Actions for Design Phase
1. Review PLAN.md thoroughly
2. Create UI/UX mockups for:
   - Enhanced template editor with variable insertion
   - CSV upload and column mapping interface
   - Analytics dashboard
   - Template library with search/filter
3. Design user flows for:
   - Template creation journey
   - Document generation process
   - Bulk generation workflow
4. Consider mobile responsive designs
5. Plan accessibility features (WCAG 2.1 AA)
