## Current State
- Cycle Number: 1
- Branch: cycle-1-✅-all-20250902-153905
- Phase: design (complete)
- PR: https://github.com/ShuhaoZQGG/smart-contract/pull/17

## Completed Work
### Planning Phase
- **Design**: Created UI/UX specifications and mockups
- **Planning**: Created architectural plan and requirements
- ✅ Created comprehensive README.md with Core Features section
- ✅ Updated README with Completed Features from Cycle 1
- ✅ Added In Progress section for Cycle 2 features
- ✅ Created detailed PLAN.md for Cycle 2 implementation
- ✅ Established 8-week development timeline
- ✅ Created PR #17 for Cycle 1 Development Pipeline

### Design Phase
- **Design**: Created comprehensive UI/UX specifications
- ✅ Updated DESIGN.md with complete user journeys for all core features
- ✅ Designed mockups for Lexical rich text editor integration
- ✅ Created responsive design specifications (mobile/tablet/desktop)
- ✅ Specified real-time collaboration UI with presence indicators
- ✅ Designed template marketplace browsing experience
- ✅ Added accessibility specifications (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
- ✅ Defined performance targets and optimization strategies
- ✅ Integrated Supabase database schema with UI components

## Pending Items
### For Implementation Phase
- RLS performance fixes (critical priority)
- Lexical editor integration
- WebSocket setup for collaboration
- Marketplace database schema implementation

## Technical Decisions
### Architecture Choices
- **Editor**: Lexical for rich text editing (chosen for React compatibility)
- **Real-time**: Supabase Realtime channels for collaboration
- **Marketplace**: PostgreSQL with separate schema for isolation
- **Performance**: Code splitting and lazy loading for optimization

### Technology Stack (Confirmed)
- Frontend: React 18.3 + TypeScript 5.6 + Vite 5.4
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions)
- Document Processing: mammoth, pdf-lib, docxtemplater
- Testing: Jest + React Testing Library

### Design Constraints for Development
- **Bundle Size**: Must maintain < 100KB initial bundle
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance required
- **Performance**: FCP < 1.5s, TTI < 3.5s, LCP < 2.5s
- **Browser Support**: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
- **Mobile First**: Touch targets minimum 44px
- **Auto-save**: 30-second intervals with debouncing

## Known Issues
### From Cycle 1 Review
- RLS performance warnings in template_shares and bulk_generations tables
- Missing indexes on foreign keys (2 locations)
- Bundle size can be further optimized (current: 106KB, target: <100KB)
- 3 skipped tests due to mock limitations

### Technical Debt
- 9 unused database indexes (informational only)
- Need E2E test coverage for critical flows
- Documentation for Edge Functions API needed

## Next Steps
### Development Priorities (Implementation Phase)
1. Fix RLS performance issues (Week 1)
2. Integrate Lexical editor (Week 2-3)
3. Implement real-time collaboration (Week 4-5)
4. Build template marketplace (Week 6-7)
5. Deploy advanced features (Week 8)
