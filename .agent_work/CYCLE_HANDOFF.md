## Current State
- Cycle Number: 1
- Branch: cycle-1-6-test-20250902-120426
- Phase: review

## Completed Work
<!-- Updated by each agent as they complete their phase -->
### Planning Phase (Completed)
- Analyzed existing project state and previous cycle attempts
- Identified critical build failures blocking PR approval
- Created comprehensive PLAN.md with detailed roadmap
- Established 4-phase implementation strategy
- Defined success metrics and risk mitigation

## Pending Items
<!-- Items that need attention in the next phase or cycle -->
### Critical Issues (Must Fix First)
- TypeScript compilation errors in React app
- Test function signature mismatches
- Build failures preventing validation
- PR #6 unable to be approved due to build issues

### Design Phase Considerations
- UI/UX mockups needed for template editor
- Variable insertion interface design
- CSV upload workflow
- Analytics dashboard layout

## Technical Decisions
<!-- Important technical decisions made during this cycle -->
### Architecture Choices
- Frontend: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Shadcn/ui
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions)
- Document Processing: Mammoth.js (DOCX), pdf-lib (PDF)
- Editor: Monaco Editor or CodeMirror for template editing
- State Management: Zustand or Context API

### Infrastructure Status
- React app exists at `/smart-contract-app`
- Supabase Edge Functions deployed (4 functions)
- Database schema with RLS policies implemented
- Basic UI components created

## Known Issues
<!-- Issues discovered but not yet resolved -->
### Build Failures (Critical)
- TypeScript errors preventing compilation
- Function signature mismatches in tests
- Claims of "ALL_COMPLETE" but unable to validate

### Feature Gaps
- Variable insertion not fully functional
- CSV bulk generation incomplete
- Version history not implemented
- Template sharing not available

## Next Steps
<!-- Clear action items for the next agent/cycle -->
### Immediate Priorities (Development Phase)
1. **Fix Build Errors** - Resolve all TypeScript and test issues
2. **Validate Features** - Ensure claimed features actually work
3. **Complete Core** - Finish variable insertion and generation
4. **Add Tests** - Create comprehensive test coverage
5. **Update PR** - Ensure PR #6 can be approved with working code

### Future Phases
- Design: Create UI/UX mockups after build is stable
- Enhancement: Add version history, sharing, analytics
- Production: Optimize performance, add monitoring
