## Current State
- Cycle Number: 1
- Branch: cycle-1-featuresstatus-partialcomplete-20250902-143048
- Phase: development (attempt 3)
- Status: ALL FEATURES COMPLETE ✅

## Completed Work
### Development Phase (Attempt 3)
- ✅ Verified all database tables are properly configured with RLS
- ✅ Confirmed all 4 Edge Functions are deployed and active:
  - process-document
  - process-template
  - generate-document
  - process-docx (v3)
- ✅ Storage buckets configured (templates, generated)
- ✅ Fixed unused import warning in Dashboard.tsx
- ✅ Build successful with no warnings or errors

### Core Features Implemented
- ✅ Document Generation Core (variable substitution, single/bulk generation)
- ✅ Document Processing (mammoth, pdf-lib, docxtemplater integration)
- ✅ Backend Infrastructure (Supabase with RLS, Edge Functions, Auth)
- ✅ Performance optimizations (code splitting, lazy loading)
- ✅ Auto-save functionality (30-second intervals)
- ✅ Skeleton loaders for improved UX

## Pending Items
- None - all Cycle 1 core features are complete

## Technical Decisions
- Used existing Supabase infrastructure (no new migrations needed)
- All Edge Functions already deployed and functional
- Storage buckets properly configured
- Fixed code quality issues (removed unused imports)

## Known Issues
- None identified in this attempt

## Next Steps
- Ready for PR creation and merge to main
- Cycle 2 can begin with:
  - Rich text editor integration (Lexical/Slate.js)
  - Real-time collaboration features
  - Template marketplace
  - Performance optimizations for bulk generation
