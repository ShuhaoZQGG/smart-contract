## Pending Items
### For Development Phase (Current)
- Implement authentication with Supabase Auth
- Build dashboard and navigation components
- Integrate Lexical editor with variable highlighting
- Implement document generation with variable substitution
- Set up real-time collaboration with Supabase Realtime
- Build marketplace UI components
- Implement advanced variable types (dropdowns, formulas)
- Add comprehensive test coverage

### Security Configuration (Immediate)
- Configure Supabase Auth settings (MFA, password policies)
- Implement rate limiting on Edge Functions
- Add audit logging for sensitive operations

## Technical Decisions
### Architecture Choices
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS
- **Rich Text Editor**: Lexical (Facebook's framework)
- **State Management**: Zustand + React Query
- **CRDT Library**: Yjs for conflict resolution
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe for marketplace
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form + Zod
- **Charts/Analytics**: Recharts
- **Testing**: Target 95% coverage (up from 87%)

### Performance Targets
- Bundle size: <100KB (currently 107KB)
- API response: <150ms p95
- Test coverage: >95%
- Lighthouse score: >95

## Known Issues
### From Previous Cycles (Non-critical)
- 12 unused database indexes (monitor before removal)
- Jest mocking issues with Supabase client (1 test suite)
- Bundle size 7KB over target

### Security Gaps (To Address)
- Leaked password protection disabled
- Insufficient MFA options
- Rate limiting not implemented

## Next Steps

### Implementation Priorities
1. Security configuration (immediate)
2. Advanced variable types
3. CRDT integration for collaboration
4. Marketplace database schema
5. API development

## Resources
- PR #24: https://github.com/ShuhaoZQGG/smart-contract/pull/24
- Previous PR #23 (merged): Cycles 1 & 2 implementation
- Supabase project configured and operational
- 4 Edge Functions deployed
- 66/79 tests passing

## Notes for Next Agent
- The project has successfully completed Cycles 1 & 2 with all core features
- Cycle 3 focuses on enhancement and enterprise features
- Security configuration should be prioritized
- Database schema exists for marketplace features but needs implementation
- Real-time collaboration foundation is in place, needs conflict resolution
