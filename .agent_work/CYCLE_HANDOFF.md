## Current State
- Cycle Number: 1
- Branch: cycle-1-3-confirmed-20250903-004843
- Phase: review

## Completed Work
<!-- Updated by each agent as they complete their phase -->
- **Planning**: Created architectural plan and requirements
- **Design**: Comprehensive UI/UX specifications completed
### Planning Phase
- ✅ Analyzed existing implementation from previous cycles
- ✅ Created comprehensive PLAN.md with architecture and requirements
- ✅ Defined clear implementation phases (Phase 2-4)
- ✅ Identified security hardening as immediate priority
- ✅ Created PR #26: Cycle 1: Development Pipeline

### Design Phase (Current)
- ✅ Analyzed core feature requirements from README.md
- ✅ Queried Supabase database schemas for UI alignment
- ✅ Created comprehensive DESIGN.md with UI/UX specifications
- ✅ Designed layouts for all core features:
  - Authentication pages with Supabase Auth UI
  - Dashboard with quick actions and activity feed
  - Rich text editor with Lexical and variable system
  - Document generation forms (single and bulk)
  - Template marketplace with rating system
- ✅ Mobile responsive designs for all pages
- ✅ Accessibility specifications (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- ✅ Real-time collaboration UI components
- ✅ Performance indicators and loading states

## Pending Items
<!-- Items that need attention in the next phase or cycle -->
### For Design Phase
- Review and refine UI/UX specifications in DESIGN.md
- Consider advanced variable types UI components
- Design conflict resolution interface for collaboration
- Plan marketplace backend API structure

### Critical Security Items
- Configure Supabase Auth MFA settings
- Implement rate limiting on Edge Functions
- Add comprehensive audit logging

## Technical Decisions
<!-- Important technical decisions made during this cycle -->
### Architecture Choices
- Maintain Supabase as primary backend infrastructure
- Use CRDT (Yjs) for real-time collaboration conflict resolution
- Target bundle size <100KB (currently at 107KB)
- Implement lazy loading and code splitting aggressively

### Priority Decisions
1. **Phase 2**: Security & Performance (immediate)
2. **Phase 3**: Advanced Features (variables, collaboration)
3. **Phase 4**: Enterprise Features (API, webhooks)

## Known Issues
<!-- Issues discovered but not yet resolved -->
### From Previous Implementation
- Jest mocking issues with Supabase client (1 test suite failing)
- Bundle size 7KB over target (107KB vs 100KB target)
- 12 unused database indexes identified
- 3 tests skipped in auth module

### Security Gaps
- MFA not configured in Supabase Auth
- No rate limiting on Edge Functions
- Missing audit logging for sensitive operations

## Next Steps
<!-- Clear action items for the next agent/cycle -->
### For Design Agent
1. Review existing DESIGN.md and enhance with Phase 2-4 requirements
2. Create detailed UI mockups for:
   - Advanced variable configuration interface
   - Conflict resolution modal
   - Marketplace backend admin panel
3. Define user flows for new features

### For Implementation Agent
1. Start with Phase 2 security hardening
2. Configure Supabase Auth settings immediately
3. Implement rate limiting middleware
4. Add audit logging system
5. Optimize bundle size below 100KB target

<!-- HANDOFF_END -->

## Design Phase Summary
- Completed: Design phase with comprehensive UI/UX specifications
- Pending: Frontend implementation with React + TypeScript
- Technical: Use Tailwind CSS, Lexical editor, Supabase Auth UI
- Priority: Focus on core features first, then advanced capabilities
