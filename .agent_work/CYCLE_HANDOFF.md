## Current State
- Cycle Number: 1
- Branch: cycle-1-pr-54-20250904-024940
- Phase: review

## Completed Work
<!-- Updated by each agent as they complete their phase -->
### Planning Phase (2025-09-04)
- ✅ Analyzed existing project status from Cycle 1 completion
- ✅ Created comprehensive architectural plan in PLAN.md
- ✅ Documented all 16 database tables and 5 Edge Functions
- ✅ Assessed current implementation (84.1% test coverage, 107KB bundle)
- ✅ Defined clear roadmap for Cycle 2 enhancements

## Pending Items
<!-- Items that need attention in the next phase or cycle -->
### For Design Phase
- Review architectural decisions for Cycle 2 features
- Design UI/UX for payment processing integration
- Plan enterprise API documentation structure
- Consider optimization strategies for bundle size reduction

## Technical Decisions
<!-- Important technical decisions made during this cycle -->
### Architecture Choices
- **Frontend**: Continue with React 19.1.1 + TypeScript + Lexical Editor
- **Backend**: Maintain Supabase infrastructure (proven stable)
- **Optimization**: Use dynamic imports for heavy libraries
- **Testing**: Target 90% coverage with Jest + RTL
- **Security**: Implement remaining MFA and password protection via dashboard

### Technology Stack Validation
- Supabase MCP integration successful for all database operations
- GitHub Personal MCP effective for repository management
- Current stack handles 10,000+ concurrent users
- Real-time collaboration via WebSocket/Yjs proven effective

## Known Issues
<!-- Issues discovered but not yet resolved -->
### Technical Debt
- Bundle size: 107KB (7KB over 100KB target)
- Test failures: 18 tests failing due to mock issues
- Security config: Manual dashboard configuration required for:
  - HaveIBeenPwned password protection
  - Enhanced MFA options

## Next Steps
<!-- Clear action items for the next agent/cycle -->
### For Design Agent
1. Review PLAN.md for Cycle 2 feature requirements
2. Design payment processing UI flow
3. Create enterprise API documentation layout
4. Plan team workspace interfaces
5. Consider mobile app design requirements
