## Current State
- Cycle Number: 1
- Branch: cycle-1-the-smart-20250902-111831
- Phase: design (completed)
- PR: https://github.com/ShuhaoZQGG/smart-contract/pull/6

## Completed Work
### Planning Phase ✅
- **Design**: Created UI/UX specifications and mockups
- **Planning**: Created architectural plan and requirements
- Analyzed existing project structure and documentation
- Created comprehensive PLAN.md with detailed requirements and architecture
- Established 5-phase implementation roadmap
- Defined success metrics and KPIs
- Created budget estimates and resource planning
- Set up git branch and created PR for Cycle 1

### Design Phase ✅
- **UI/UX Design**: Created comprehensive design specifications
- Designed 5 main page layouts with ASCII mockups
- Created user journeys for first-time, power, and editor users
- Specified component design system with Shadcn/ui
- Defined accessibility features (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Planned mobile responsive breakpoints
- Integrated Supabase Auth UI components
- Established interaction patterns and performance targets

## Pending Items
### For Development Phase
- Implement React + TypeScript frontend with Vite
- Set up Shadcn/ui component library
- Integrate Supabase Auth with custom theming
- Build template editor with variable insertion
- Create document generation endpoints
- Implement CSV bulk processing
- Add real-time updates via Supabase channels

### Technical Constraints
- Frontend must use existing Supabase database schema
- Maintain WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
- Target <200KB initial bundle size
- Support both DOCX and PDF output formats

## Technical Decisions
### Architecture Choices Made
1. **Frontend Stack**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Shadcn/ui
   - Rationale: Modern, performant, excellent DX, built-in accessibility
   
2. **Backend**: Supabase Platform
   - Rationale: Integrated auth/storage/realtime, cost-effective, scalable
   
3. **Document Processing**: Edge Functions with Deno
   - Rationale: Serverless, auto-scaling, close to data
   
4. **State Management**: Tanstack Query + Zustand
   - Rationale: Efficient caching, simple state management

### Database Design
- Schema already implemented and optimized
- RLS policies performance issues resolved
- Indexes optimized for query patterns

## Known Issues
### From Previous Implementation
- All critical issues resolved ✅
- 0 security warnings
- Only INFO level advisories remain

### Current Considerations
- Need to enhance template editor UI
- CSV processing interface needs implementation
- Analytics dashboard pending

## Next Steps
### Immediate Actions for Development Phase
1. Set up React + Vite project structure
2. Install and configure Shadcn/ui components
3. Implement Supabase client and auth integration
4. Build dashboard page with template cards
5. Create template editor with Monaco/CodeMirror
6. Implement variable insertion and validation
7. Add document generation API calls
8. Test accessibility with screen readers
9. Optimize bundle size and performance

### Frontend Framework Recommendations
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast HMR and optimized builds
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui for accessibility and customization
- **State Management**: Zustand for simplicity, Tanstack Query for server state
- **Editor**: Monaco Editor or CodeMirror for template editing
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod for validation
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library
