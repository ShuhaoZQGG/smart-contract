## Current State
- Cycle Number: 1
- Branch: cycle-1-âœ…-advanced-20250903-022126
- Phase: development (attempt 2)

## Completed Work
### Performance & Security Improvements (Attempt 2)
- **Database Performance Optimizations**:
  - Added 12 missing indexes for foreign keys across all new tables
  - Optimized 13 RLS policies by replacing `auth.uid()` with `(select auth.uid())`
  - Applied migrations directly via Supabase MCP

- **Security Enhancements**:
  - Created `authConfig.ts` service for auth security management
  - Implemented `SecuritySettings` component with:
    - Multi-factor authentication (TOTP, SMS)
    - Backup codes generation
    - Password strength validation
    - Leaked password checking (HaveIBeenPwned API)
    - Security status overview
  - Added comprehensive test coverage (10 new tests)

- **Test Results**:
  - All 86 tests passing (3 skipped due to auth)
  - New security components fully tested
  - No TypeScript errors
  - Build successful

## Pending Items
- Configure Supabase Auth settings in dashboard:
  - Enable leaked password protection
  - Enable additional MFA methods
  - Configure password strength requirements
- Consider removing unused indexes after monitoring
- Implement rate limiting on Edge Functions

## Technical Decisions
- Used Supabase MCP tools for direct migration application
- Implemented client-side password leak checking (should move to server-side in production)
- Created modular auth configuration service for flexibility
- Added comprehensive security UI components with tests

## Known Issues
- Some unused indexes remain (monitoring needed before removal)
- Auth configuration requires dashboard access (cannot be done programmatically)
- Multiple permissive policies warnings (non-critical, for monitoring)

## Next Steps
1. Create PR for security and performance improvements
2. Configure Supabase Auth settings manually in dashboard
3. Monitor index usage before cleanup
4. Consider implementing server-side password validation
