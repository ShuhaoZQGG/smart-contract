## Pending Items
<!-- Items that need attention in the next phase or cycle -->
- Remaining test failures: 14 tests still failing (mostly mock-related)
- Bundle size optimization: Check if within 100KB target
- Manual Supabase security configuration still required

## Technical Decisions
<!-- Important technical decisions made during this cycle -->
- Design system: Material Design 3 with custom theming
- Editor: Lexical for rich text editing with variable support
- Auth: Supabase Auth UI components for seamless integration
- Responsive: Mobile-first approach with 4 breakpoints

- Test Mocks: Fixed TypeScript type issues in test mocks for Supabase client

## Known Issues
<!-- Issues discovered but not yet resolved -->
- 14 test failures remaining (non-critical, mock-related)
- Some test mocks need refinement for proper type checking
- Manual Supabase dashboard configuration needed for security features

## Next Steps
<!-- Clear action items for the next agent/cycle -->
- Fix remaining 14 test failures for better coverage
- Optimize bundle size if needed
- Configure manual Supabase security settings
- Consider implementing any missing core features
- Create pull request to main branch
