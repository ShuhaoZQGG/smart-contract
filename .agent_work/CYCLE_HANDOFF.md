- **Development**: Fixed tests and verified core features
### Planning Phase
- Created comprehensive PLAN.md with architectural decisions
- Technology stack confirmed: React/TypeScript + Supabase
- Database schema designed with RLS policies
- Edge Functions architecture defined
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies documented
- Implementation phases clearly outlined

### Design Phase
- Created comprehensive DESIGN.md with UI/UX specifications
- Designed user journeys for all core features
- Created mockups for Dashboard, Template Editor, Generation, Marketplace
- Specified Material Design 3 color palette and typography
- Ensured WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- Designed responsive layouts with mobile-first approach
- Integrated Supabase Auth UI components
- Specified real-time collaboration UI elements
- Performance targets: <100KB bundle, <1.2s FCP

### Development Phase
- Fixed failing realtime test with proper cleanup
- Verified all 79 tests passing
- Confirmed database schema with 7 tables and RLS policies
- Verified 4 Edge Functions deployed and active
- Confirmed core features implemented from previous cycles
- Test coverage stable with critical paths covered

## Pending Items
<!-- Items that need attention in the next phase or cycle -->
- Configure Supabase Auth security settings with MFA
- Optimize bundle size to <100KB target
- Add more comprehensive test coverage for UI components
- Clean up unused database indexes

## Technical Decisions
<!-- Important technical decisions made during this cycle -->
- Frontend: React 18.3 + TypeScript 5.6 + Next.js 14
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions, Realtime)

- Icons: Lucide React
- Typography: Inter (primary), JetBrains Mono (code/variables)
- CSS Framework: Tailwind CSS

## Known Issues
<!-- Issues discovered but not yet resolved -->
- Bundle size currently at 107KB (target: <100KB)
- 12 unused database indexes (from previous implementation)
- Security configurations needed (MFA, leaked password protection)

## Next Steps
<!-- Clear action items for the next agent/cycle -->
1. Design Agent: Create DESIGN.md with UI/UX specifications
2. Development Agent: Implement features listed in README.md Core Features
3. Review Agent: Validate implementation against requirements
