Updated: Wed  3 Sep 2025 (Design Phase)

## Current State
- Cycle Number: 1
- Branch: cycle-1-1-verified-20250903-030420
- Phase: design → development (ready for next phase)
- PR: #31 (https://github.com/ShuhaoZQGG/smart-contract/pull/31)

## Completed Work
### Planning Phase ✅
- **Planning**: Created architectural plan and requirements
- Analyzed existing implementation from PR #25 (already merged to main)
- Updated PLAN.md with comprehensive architectural decisions
- Documented technology stack: React/TypeScript + Supabase
- Defined database schema with 7 core tables + RLS policies
- Specified 4 Edge Functions for document processing
- Created implementation roadmap with 5 phases
- Established performance targets and metrics

### Design Phase ✅
- **UI/UX Design**: Created comprehensive design specifications in DESIGN.md
- Defined Material Design 3 based design system with brand colors
- Created detailed user journeys for all core workflows
- Designed page layouts: Dashboard, Template Editor, Generation Form, Marketplace
- Specified component library and reusable UI patterns
- Established responsive design breakpoints and mobile adaptations
- Documented WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility requirements
- Created performance optimization strategies
- Defined animation and micro-interaction patterns

## Pending Items
### For Development Phase
- Implement UI components based on design specifications
- Integrate with Supabase backend (16 tables already exist)
- Connect to Edge Functions for document processing
- Implement real-time collaboration features
- Add authentication flow with Supabase Auth
- Test all core user journeys

### For Future Cycles
- Configure Supabase Auth security settings (manual dashboard config required)
- Enable HaveIBeenPwned password protection
- Configure additional MFA options
- Implement advanced variable types
- Complete marketplace backend implementation

## Technical Decisions
### Architecture Choices
1. **Frontend**: React 18.3 + TypeScript + Lexical Editor
2. **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions, Realtime)
3. **Document Processing**: mammoth.js, pdf-lib, docxtemplater
4. **State Management**: Zustand + React Query
5. **UI Framework**: Shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS
6. **Build Tool**: Vite

### Design Decisions
1. **Design System**: Material Design 3 principles
2. **Color Palette**: Blue primary (#2563EB), Emerald secondary (#10B981)
3. **Typography**: Inter for UI, Monaco for code/variables
4. **Icons**: Lucide React icon library
5. **Responsive Grid**: 4/8/12 column system
6. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

### Database Design
- 7 core tables with Row Level Security
- JSONB for flexible variable storage
- UUID primary keys for all tables
- Proper foreign key relationships

### API Strategy
- Edge Functions for serverless processing
- RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations
- WebSocket via Supabase Realtime for collaboration
- Future: OpenAPI specification for enterprise API

## Known Issues
### From Previous Implementation (PR #25)
1. **Security Configuration**: Requires manual Supabase dashboard configuration
2. **Test Coverage**: 3 tests failing (86/89 passing - 96.6%)
3. **Bundle Size**: 107KB (7KB over 100KB target)
4. **Database**: 12 unused indexes (non-critical)

### Current Considerations
- Need to verify all components integrate properly
- Marketplace backend not yet implemented (UI ready)
- Advanced variable types planned for future cycles

## Next Steps
### Immediate (Development Phase)
1. Set up React project with TypeScript and Vite
2. Install and configure Shadcn/ui components
3. Implement authentication with Supabase Auth UI
4. Build core UI layouts based on design specs
5. Create template editor with Lexical integration
6. Connect to Supabase backend APIs
7. Test document generation flow end-to-end

### After Development Phase
1. Verify all implemented features work together
2. Fix remaining test failures
3. Configure security settings in Supabase dashboard
4. Optimize bundle size below 100KB
5. Prepare for production deployment
