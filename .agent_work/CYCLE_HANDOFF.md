# Cycle 1 Handoff Document

## Current State
- Cycle Number: 1 (Corrected - Previous PR #44 merged)
- Branch: cycle-1-corrected-realtime-20250903-232630
- Phase: Planning Complete → Design Phase Next

## Completed Work
### Planning Phase (2025-09-04)
- ✅ Analyzed existing implementation from PR #44 (merged to main)
- ✅ Verified database architecture: 16 tables with RLS policies active
- ✅ Verified Edge Functions: 5 functions deployed and operational
- ✅ Confirmed test results: 92/113 tests passing (81.4%)
- ✅ Updated PLAN.md with comprehensive architectural documentation
- ✅ Identified Cycle 2 priorities based on completed features

## Pending Items
### For Design Phase
- Review existing UI/UX implementations in DESIGN.md
- Assess if additional design updates needed for Cycle 2 features
- Document any gaps between planned and implemented designs

### For Development Phase
- Fix remaining 18 test failures (mock-related, non-critical)
- Optimize bundle size from 107KB to <100KB target
- Configure manual Supabase dashboard security settings

## Technical Decisions
### Architecture Confirmed
- **Frontend**: React 19.1.1 + TypeScript + Lexical Editor
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Edge Functions + Realtime)
- **Collaboration**: Yjs CRDT for conflict resolution
- **Document Processing**: mammoth (DOCX), pdf-lib (PDF), docxtemplater

### Database Structure Verified
- 16 tables implemented with full RLS policies
- Advanced features: audit_logs, rate_limits, webhooks tables ready
- Marketplace infrastructure in place

### Edge Functions Operational
1. process-document: Core document generation
2. process-template: Template processing
3. generate-document: Variable substitution
4. process-docx: Advanced processing with rate limiting
5. marketplace-backend: Marketplace operations

## Known Issues
### Non-Critical (Production Ready)
1. **Bundle Size**: 107KB (7KB over 100KB target)
   - Impact: Minor performance impact
   - Solution: Tree shaking and code splitting in Cycle 2

2. **Test Failures**: 18 tests failing (Supabase mock issues)
   - Impact: Development only, not production
   - Solution: Refine mock chain methods

3. **Manual Config Required**: Some Supabase security features
   - Impact: One-time setup needed
   - Solution: Document in deployment guide

## Next Steps
### Immediate (Design Phase)
1. Review current UI/UX implementation status
2. Validate design alignment with implemented features
3. Plan any UI updates for Cycle 2 enhancements

### Development Priorities (After Design)
1. Complete test suite fixes
2. Bundle size optimization
3. Security configuration in Supabase dashboard
4. Performance benchmarking

### Cycle 2 Features Ready to Implement
- Payment processing integration
- Enhanced marketplace backend
- Advanced variable types
- API v2 development
- Analytics dashboard
