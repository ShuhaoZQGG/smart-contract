## Current State
- Cycle Number: 1
- Branch: cycle-1-1-verified-20250903-030420
- Phase: Planning Complete

## Completed Work
### Planning Phase âœ…
- Analyzed existing implementation from PRs #25, #29, #30
- Verified 86/89 tests passing (96.6% success rate)
- Confirmed 16 Supabase tables with RLS policies deployed
- Validated 4 Edge Functions operational
- Identified security configurations needed in dashboard
- Created refined architectural plan in PLAN.md

### Key Findings
- All core features implemented and functional
- Real-time collaboration infrastructure complete
- Template marketplace UI ready
- Bundle size optimized to 107KB
- Comprehensive test coverage achieved

## Pending Items
### Manual Configuration Required
- Enable HaveIBeenPwned password protection in Supabase dashboard
- Configure MFA options (TOTP, SMS)
- Set password complexity requirements

### Testing Improvements
- Fix 3 remaining test failures
- Add E2E test suite
- Performance benchmarking needed

## Technical Decisions
### Architecture Choices
- React 18 + TypeScript for frontend
- Lexical editor for rich text editing
- Supabase for complete backend infrastructure
- Edge Functions for serverless processing
- Real-time collaboration via WebSockets

### Technology Stack Validated
- mammoth for DOCX processing
- pdf-lib for PDF generation
- docxtemplater for template processing
- Supabase Realtime for collaboration
- Material Design 3 for UI consistency

## Known Issues
### Non-Critical
- 33 unused database indexes (performance advisors)
- Bundle size slightly above 100KB target (currently 107KB)
- 3 tests failing (likely mocking issues)

### Security Warnings
- Leaked password protection not enabled
- Limited MFA options configured

## Next Steps
### For Design Phase
1. Review current UI implementation against DESIGN.md specs
2. Identify any UI/UX gaps or improvements needed
3. Ensure mobile responsiveness is fully implemented
4. Validate accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)

### For Development Phase
1. Fix remaining 3 test failures
2. Implement E2E testing suite
3. Configure security settings via Supabase dashboard
4. Optimize bundle size below 100KB if possible
5. Add any missing API documentation
