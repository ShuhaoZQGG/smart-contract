## Current State
- Cycle Number: 1
- Branch: cycle-1-✅-all-20250903-015224
- Phase: planning (complete)
- PR: https://github.com/ShuhaoZQGG/smart-contract/pull/28

## Completed Work
<!-- Updated by each agent as they complete their phase -->

### Planning Phase ✅
- Analyzed existing README.md with comprehensive feature list
- Reviewed previous cycles (1-2 complete, merged in PR #22)
- Created PLAN.md with:
  - Requirements analysis aligned with README.md
  - Tech stack confirmation (React, TypeScript, Supabase)
  - Architecture overview with database schema
  - 4-phase development approach
  - Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Created PR #28 for Cycle 1 development pipeline

## Pending Items
<!-- Items that need attention in the next phase or cycle -->

### For Design Phase
- Create UI/UX specifications in DESIGN.md for:
  - Advanced collaboration features (conflict resolution UI)
  - Commenting system interface
  - Marketplace rating/review components
  - Enterprise feature interfaces

### For Development Phase (Priority Order)
1. **Advanced Collaboration**
   - Implement conflict resolution for simultaneous edits
   - Add commenting system on templates
   - Version control and rollback functionality

2. **Marketplace Backend**
   - Rating and review system
   - Template monetization
   - Analytics tracking

3. **Enterprise Features**
   - Advanced variable types (conditional, computed)
   - API integrations
   - Webhook support

## Technical Decisions
<!-- Important technical decisions made during this cycle -->

### Architecture Decisions
- Continue with existing tech stack (React 18, TypeScript, Supabase)
- Use CRDT or operational transforms for conflict resolution
- Implement queue system for batch processing
- Maintain <150KB bundle size target

### Database Schema Extensions
- Add tables for comments, ratings, analytics
- Extend collaboration_sessions for conflict tracking
- Add marketplace monetization fields

## Known Issues
<!-- Issues discovered but not yet resolved -->

### From Previous Review (REVIEW.md)
- Dashboard configuration needed:
  - Enable HaveIBeenPwned password protection
  - Configure MFA options (TOTP recommended)

### Technical Debt
- Some test coverage gaps in collaboration features
- Performance optimization needed for large CSV processing

## Next Steps
<!-- Clear action items for the next agent/cycle -->

### Immediate Actions (Design Phase)
1. Read PLAN.md to understand architecture
2. Create comprehensive UI/UX specifications in DESIGN.md
3. Design mockups for new features
4. Define user flows for collaboration and marketplace
5. Commit and push changes to PR #28

### Development Priorities
1. Start with conflict resolution implementation
2. Add commenting system
3. Build marketplace backend
4. Implement enterprise features

### Success Criteria
- Test coverage > 95%
- Zero critical vulnerabilities
- Lighthouse score > 90
- Bundle size < 150KB
