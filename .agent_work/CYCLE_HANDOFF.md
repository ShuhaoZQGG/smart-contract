## Current State
- Cycle Number: 1
- Branch: cycle-1-featuresstatus-allcomplete-20250904-042911
- Phase: planning (complete)
- PR: https://github.com/ShuhaoZQGG/smart-contract/pull/62

## Completed Work
<!-- Updated by each agent as they complete their phase -->
- **Planning**: Created architectural plan and requirements
- **Design**: Completed UI/UX specifications with full feature coverage

### Planning Phase (2025-09-04)
- ✅ Verified existing infrastructure via Supabase MCP
  - All 16 database tables operational with RLS
  - 5 Edge Functions deployed and ACTIVE
  - Authentication and storage configured
- ✅ Analyzed current test coverage (96/113 passing, 85%)
- ✅ Updated PLAN.md with comprehensive architecture
- ✅ Created branch and PR for Cycle 1
- ✅ Documented Cycle 2 development priorities

### Design Phase (2025-09-04)
- ✅ Created comprehensive DESIGN.md with Material Design 3 system
- ✅ Designed UI for ALL core features from README.md
- ✅ Aligned UI components with all 16 Supabase tables
- ✅ Created responsive layouts for mobile, tablet, desktop
- ✅ Ensured WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- ✅ Designed real-time collaboration views using Supabase Realtime
- ✅ Created marketplace UI with rating/review system
- ✅ Specified advanced variable configuration interfaces
- ✅ Designed bulk generation and CSV processing flows
- ✅ Included edge function monitoring dashboard

## Pending Items
<!-- Items that need attention in the next phase or cycle -->
- Bundle size optimization (currently 107KB, target <100KB)
- Manual security configuration in Supabase Dashboard
- 17 UI test failures (non-blocking, mocks need refinement)

## Technical Decisions
<!-- Important technical decisions made during this cycle -->
- Confirmed Supabase as primary backend infrastructure
- Verified all core features operational from Cycle 1
- Prioritized marketplace monetization for Cycle 2
- Maintaining existing tech stack (React, TypeScript, Supabase)
- Using Material Design 3 for consistent UI/UX
- Lexical editor for rich text editing with variable support
- Implementing Supabase Realtime for collaboration features

## Design Constraints for Development
<!-- UI/UX decisions that impact implementation -->
- Minimum touch target 44x44px for mobile
- 4.5:1 contrast ratio for WCAG compliance
- Auto-save every 10 seconds for editor
- Variable syntax highlighting with Fira Code font
- Real-time presence indicators using WebSocket
- Skeleton screens for loading states
- Toast notifications positioning (desktop: top-right, mobile: bottom)

## Frontend Framework Recommendations
<!-- Recommended libraries and tools for development -->
- **State Management**: Zustand or Redux Toolkit for global state
- **Routing**: React Router v6 with lazy loading
- **UI Components**: Material-UI v5 or Radix UI with Tailwind
- **Rich Text**: Lexical with custom variable plugin
- **Real-time**: Supabase Realtime client with Yjs for CRDT
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Animation**: Framer Motion for micro-interactions
- **Charts**: Recharts for analytics dashboard
- **File Processing**: mammoth.js for DOCX, pdf-lib for PDF

## Known Issues
<!-- Issues discovered but not yet resolved -->
- Bundle size 7KB over target (non-critical)
- HaveIBeenPwned protection needs manual configuration
- Some test mocks require updates

## Next Steps
<!-- Clear action items for the next agent/cycle -->
1. Development phase: Implement UI components based on DESIGN.md
2. Focus on optimizing bundle size during implementation
3. Implement real-time collaboration with Supabase Realtime
4. Create responsive layouts with Material Design breakpoints
5. Ensure all variable insertion methods work seamlessly
