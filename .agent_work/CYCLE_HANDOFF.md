## Completed Work
### Planning Phase
- **Planning**: Created architectural plan and requirements
- Created comprehensive PLAN.md with architectural decisions
- Analyzed existing implementation from Cycle 2
- Identified completed features and pending enhancements
- Established roadmap for next phases

### Design Phase
- **UI/UX Design**: Created comprehensive design specifications

## Next Steps
### For Development Phase
1. Implement enhanced template editor with variable insertion
2. Build document generation pipeline with Edge Functions
3. Integrate WebSocket for bulk generation progress tracking
4. Implement CSV upload and column mapping interface
5. Add document preview functionality
6. Integrate docxtemplater and pdf-lib libraries

## Design Constraints for Development
- Use existing Supabase schema (profiles, templates, template_versions, variables, generated_documents)
- Maintain React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS stack
- Follow established color palette and design system
- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Implement auto-save with 5-second debounce in editor
- Use React Query for API state management
