## Current State
- Cycle Number: 1
- Branch: cycle-1-successfully-implemented-20250902-152746
- Phase: development (attempt 2)
- Status: ALL FEATURES COMPLETE ✅

## Completed Work
### Development Phase (Attempt 2)
- ✅ Verified all database tables are properly configured with RLS (7 tables)
- ✅ Confirmed all 4 Edge Functions are deployed and active:
  - process-document
  - process-template
  - generate-document
  - process-docx (v3)
- ✅ Storage buckets configured (templates, generated)
- ✅ Build successful with no warnings or errors
- ✅ All 49 tests passing (5 test suites)
- ✅ TypeScript type check passing with no errors
- ✅ Application starts successfully on localhost:3000
- ✅ No security vulnerabilities in Supabase advisors

### Core Features Implemented
- ✅ **Document Generation Core**
  - Variable substitution system with {{variable}} syntax
  - Single document generation with variable replacement
  - Bulk generation from CSV data
  - Base64 encoding for binary formats
  
- ✅ **Document Processing**
  - DOCX text extraction (mammoth)
  - PDF generation (pdf-lib)
  - Template processing (docxtemplater + pizzip)
  - Format conversion utilities
  
- ✅ **Backend Infrastructure**
  - Supabase database with RLS policies
  - 4 Edge Functions deployed
  - Authentication system
  - Storage bucket configured
  
- ✅ **Performance & UX Enhancements**
  - Code splitting with lazy loading (bundle: 546KB → 106KB)
  - Comprehensive skeleton loaders
  - Auto-save at 30-second intervals
  - Suspense boundaries for smooth transitions

## Pending Items
- None - all Cycle 1 core features are complete and tested

## Technical Decisions
- Used existing Supabase infrastructure from PR #13
- All Edge Functions already deployed and functional
- Storage buckets properly configured
- Build optimizations already applied

## Known Issues
- None identified - application runs cleanly

## Next Steps
- Ready for PR creation and merge to main
- Cycle 2 can begin with:
  - Rich text editor integration (Lexical/Slate.js)
  - Real-time collaboration features
  - Template marketplace
  - Advanced variable types (dropdowns, dates, formulas)
  - RLS policy optimizations
