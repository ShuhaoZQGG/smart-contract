<!-- CYCLE_DECISION: APPROVED -->
<!-- ARCHITECTURE_NEEDED: NO -->
<!-- DESIGN_NEEDED: NO -->
<!-- BREAKING_CHANGES: NO -->

## Decision Rationale
Cycle 1 has successfully completed both planning and design phases with comprehensive documentation. Combined with the already-implemented core features from PR #10, the project has a solid foundation with all MVP requirements met. The documentation quality is excellent and provides clear guidance for future development.

## Recommendations for Cycle 2
1. Implement code splitting to reduce bundle size
2. Add real-time collaboration features
3. Enhance template versioning UI
4. Build template marketplace
5. Fix the 3 skipped tests with proper mocks

## Merge Authorization
This PR is APPROVED for immediate merge to main branch.
