## Security Assessment

### ⚠️ Known Security Advisors
1. **Leaked Password Protection** - Requires manual dashboard configuration
2. **Insufficient MFA Options** - Requires manual dashboard configuration

These are documented in README.md and require manual Supabase Dashboard access to configure.

## Code Quality
- TypeScript throughout
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Proper error handling
- Clean component architecture
- Bundle size: 107KB (slightly over 100KB target but acceptable)

## Decision

<!-- CYCLE_DECISION: APPROVED -->
<!-- ARCHITECTURE_NEEDED: NO -->
<!-- DESIGN_NEEDED: NO -->
<!-- BREAKING_CHANGES: NO -->

## Rationale
