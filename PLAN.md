# Smart Contract Document Template System - Architectural Plan

## Executive Summary
Enterprise-grade document automation platform with variable-based personalization, real-time collaboration, and marketplace capabilities. Built on React/TypeScript with Supabase backend.

## Project Vision
A tool that lets users upload any document, manually insert variables like {{client_name}} where needed, then generate personalized versions by simply filling in the variable values. Leveraging GitHub-personal MCP and Supabase MCP for enhanced integration.
